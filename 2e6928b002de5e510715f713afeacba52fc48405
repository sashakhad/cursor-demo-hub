tldr: The user wants to change the width of an image from 12px to 30px. The
  assistant is currently searching the codebase to locate the image component
  and determine the best way to apply this style change, considering it might be
  a Next.js Image component.
overview: The user wants to persist a CSS style change that was previewed in a
  browser. The change involves increasing the width of an image from 12px to
  30px. The assistant recognized that the image is likely a Next.js
  component, which often manages dimensions through  and  props
  rather than direct CSS. The current approach involves searching the codebase
  for the specific image component to identify whether the width should be
  updated via CSS or by modifying the component's props.
