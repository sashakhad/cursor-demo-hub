  30px. The assistant identified the image as a Next.js Image component and
  updated its  prop in  from 12 to 30.
overview: The user wanted to persist a browser-previewed CSS change,
  specifically increasing the width of an arrow image from 12px to 30px. The
  assistant identified the target element as a Next.js  component, which
  controls its dimensions via  and  props rather than direct CSS.
  The approach involved locating the  component rendering
   in  and directly updating its
   prop from  to . A key decision was to modify the component's
  prop instead of searching for a CSS rule, aligning with how Next.js Image
  components handle sizing. The outcome was a successful update to the image's
  width, with no linting errors introduced.
