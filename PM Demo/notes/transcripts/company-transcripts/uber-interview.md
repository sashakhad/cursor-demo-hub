**Interviewer:** Hey everyone! Thanks so much for joining today. I know you're all incredibly busy, so I really appreciate you carving out time for this.

**Patricia Chen:** Happy to be here!

**Mark Thompson:** Yeah, no problem. We're always interested in talking about recruiting tech.

**Sophia Kim:** Same here. Looking forward to the conversation.

**Interviewer:** Awesome. So just to set expectations, we're doing these customer discovery interviews to understand how companies are approaching sourcing in 2024. We want to learn from you—what's working, what's not, what you wish existed. This is purely research for us, no sales pitch involved. Sound good?

**Sophia Kim:** Sounds perfect.

**Interviewer:** Great. Let's start with some context. Can you give me an overview of Uber's recruiting operation? Team size, hiring volume, all that good stuff?

**Sophia Kim:** Sure. So we have a pretty large recruiting organization—probably around seventy people globally when you include recruiters, sourcers, coordinators, and recruiting ops. In terms of hiring volume, we're doing somewhere around eighty to ninety hires per quarter right now. That's across all functions—engineering, product, data science, operations, go-to-market.

**Mark Thompson:** On the engineering side specifically, which is where Patricia and I focus, we're probably doing forty-five to fifty eng hires per quarter. It's a healthy pace.

**Patricia Chen:** And the engineering roles are super varied. We're hiring for everything from mobile engineers to backend platform engineers to data engineers to ML engineers. It's a really diverse set of technical roles.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense for a company of Uber's scale. And what's your current tech stack? What are you using for ATS and sourcing?

**Sophia Kim:** We're on Greenhouse for our ATS. We've been with them for probably six or seven years at this point. Before that, we were on a custom-built internal system, but we migrated to Greenhouse as we scaled.

**Patricia Chen:** For sourcing, we're primarily using Jewel, which we adopted about two years ago. That's our main sourcing platform. We also have LinkedIn Recruiter, obviously—that's pretty much standard at this point.

**Mark Thompson:** We also have access to Greenhouse's AI sourcing module. It came bundled with our contract, but honestly, most of us don't use it that much. Jewel is where we do most of our sourcing work.

**Interviewer:** Okay, interesting. So you're a Jewel customer. How did you end up choosing Jewel?

**Sophia Kim:** We did a pretty extensive vendor evaluation about two years ago. We looked at all the major players—SeekOut, HireEZ, Gem, Juicebox, Jewel. We brought in a cross-functional team to evaluate them, ran trials, did side-by-side comparisons. Ultimately, we chose Jewel because of the user experience and the AI capabilities.

**Patricia Chen:** The AI intake form was a huge selling point for us. It makes the initial search setup so much faster and easier. And the overall interface is just really clean and intuitive—it doesn't feel cluttered or overwhelming like some of the other tools we tried.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear. So you've been using Jewel for about two years now. How's it been going?

**Sophia Kim:** Overall, really well. Adoption across the team has been strong, which is always a good indicator. And we're seeing good results in our sourcing metrics—response rates are up, time-to-fill is down, quality of hire has improved.

**Mark Thompson:** I personally can't imagine going back to how we used to do things. Jewel has become an essential part of my daily workflow.

**Interviewer:** That's awesome to hear. Okay, so let's dig into the details. You mentioned you're hiring a lot of different types of engineering roles. Can you walk me through your sourcing approach for a specific role?

**Patricia Chen:** Sure. Let me think of a recent example. We just filled a Senior Backend Engineer role for our ride-sharing platform team. This was someone who would be working on the core matching algorithms, real-time request handling, that kind of thing. It's pretty specialized work.

**Interviewer:** Okay.

**Patricia Chen:** So my process always starts with a really deep intake conversation with the hiring manager. What are we actually looking for? What's the tech stack? What problems will this person be solving? For this ride-sharing backend role, the must-haves were: experience with high-scale distributed systems, real-time data processing, preferably Go or Java experience, and ideally some experience in the ride-sharing or on-demand delivery space.

**Interviewer:** Right.

**Patricia Chen:** And then once I have that clarity, I go into Jewel and start building out my search. And this is where it gets interesting, because "backend engineer" is such a broad category. The search strategy for a ride-sharing backend engineer is completely different from, say, a payments platform engineer or a mapping/geolocation engineer.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about that. How are they different?

**Patricia Chen:** So for the ride-sharing backend engineer, I'm filtering for people who've worked at companies with on-demand, real-time matching systems. So I'm looking at Uber, obviously, but also Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates, even companies like Airbnb that have real-time booking systems. I'm looking for engineers whose descriptions mention things like "matching algorithms," "real-time systems," "distributed systems," "high-throughput."

**Interviewer:** Okay.

**Patricia Chen:** But if I were hiring for a payments platform engineer, I'd have a totally different filter set. For that, I'd be looking at companies with complex payment systems—Stripe, PayPal, Square, Braintree, Adyen. I'd be looking for engineers who mention "payments," "financial transactions," "PCI compliance," "fraud detection." It's a completely different profile.

**Mark Thompson:** And this persona-based approach is something we've really leaned into over the last year. We've realized that generic searches just don't cut it for the types of specialized roles we're hiring for.

**Interviewer:** So you have different personas for different types of backend engineering roles?

**Patricia Chen:** Exactly. I have a saved filter set in Jewel for ride-sharing backend engineers, another one for payments platform engineers, another one for mapping/geolocation engineers, and another one for driver-facing mobile engineers. Each persona has its own set of filters, target companies, keywords, all of that.

**Interviewer:** How many personas do you have total?

**Patricia Chen:** For mobility platform roles specifically, I have four. The ride-sharing backend one, the payments platform one, the mapping/geolocation one, and the driver-facing mobile one. Mark has his own set of personas for different roles he recruits for.

**Mark Thompson:** Yeah, I focus more on infrastructure and platform engineering. I have personas for SRE roles, data platform roles, ML infrastructure roles, and a few others. I think I have six or seven at this point.

**Sophia Kim:** And we're trying to scale this approach across the whole team. Patricia and Mark have been our pioneers here, but we're seeing that this persona-based thinking is applicable to pretty much every role family.

**Interviewer:** That's fascinating. Sophia, as the manager, when you look at the results from folks using this persona-based approach versus folks who aren't, what are you seeing?

**Sophia Kim:** The results are night and day. The folks who've built out personas and saved filter sets—their response rates are significantly higher, their candidates are better fits, their time-to-fill is faster. It's really compelling data.

**Patricia Chen:** And candidates notice it too. I've had so many people reply and say something like, "Wow, this actually seems relevant to my background." It sounds basic, but most recruiting outreach is so generic that when you're actually targeted, it stands out.

**Interviewer:** That makes total sense. Okay, so let's talk about Jewel specifically. You mentioned the AI intake form was a big part of your decision. How are you using that feature?

**Patricia Chen:** I use it for pretty much every new search. Instead of manually building out all the filters and Boolean strings, I just have a conversation with the AI. It asks me questions about the role—title, skills, target companies, seniority level, all that—and then it builds out the search for me.

**Interviewer:** And how accurate is it? Does it usually get it right?

**Patricia Chen:** It's pretty accurate. I'd say like eighty-five percent of the time, it nails it right out of the gate. And when it doesn't, I can just tweak the filters manually. The nice thing is that it's totally transparent—I can see all the filters it applied, so I'm not just trusting a black box.

**Mark Thompson:** For newer recruiters especially, the AI intake form has been huge. It helps them get up to speed so much faster because they don't need to be Boolean search experts on day one. The AI guides them through the process.

**Sophia Kim:** And it creates consistency across the team. When everyone's using the AI intake form, everyone's building searches in a similar way, which means the quality of our sourcing is more consistent.

**Interviewer:** That's really interesting. So it's like a training tool and a productivity tool rolled into one.

**Sophia Kim:** Exactly. It's one of those features that has benefits beyond the obvious time-saving aspect.

**Interviewer:** Got it. Okay, let's talk about the other tools you mentioned. You said you have Greenhouse AI sourcing but don't use it much. Why is that?

**Mark Thompson:** I gave it a fair shot for a couple of months, but I ended up moving away from it. The main issue was that the results just weren't as good as what I could get from Jewel. The candidates it was suggesting felt generic and not tailored to the specific requirements I had.

**Interviewer:** Can you give me a specific example?

**Mark Thompson:** Sure. So I was hiring for a data platform engineer—someone with deep experience in building large-scale data pipelines, working with tools like Spark, Kafka, Airflow, all that. I put the job description into Greenhouse AI, and it gave me back a bunch of generic backend engineers and some data scientists. But they weren't data platform specialists. The AI was doing keyword matching rather than actually understanding the role.

**Patricia Chen:** And the UX is just not great. It feels like Greenhouse bolted the AI feature onto the existing product rather than building it natively. It's a separate tab, separate workflow. It doesn't integrate smoothly with how we actually work.

**Interviewer:** Right. So integration and workflow matter a lot to you.

**Patricia Chen:** Hugely. We're in these tools eight hours a day. If something doesn't fit into our workflow naturally, it's just adding friction, and we're not going to use it.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Okay, let's talk about pain points more broadly. What are the biggest challenges you're facing in sourcing right now?

**Sophia Kim:** Data staleness is probably our number one pain point. Contact data goes stale so quickly in tech. People change jobs, email addresses change, and by the time we reach out, the information is outdated. We get bounced emails all the time.

**Patricia Chen:** Yeah, it's really frustrating. It wastes our time, and it makes us look out of touch to candidates. We're trying to build relationships with people, and when we reach out with stale information, it's not a good look.

**Mark Thompson:** The other big pain point for me is just the sheer volume of tools we're using. I've got Jewel open, LinkedIn open, Greenhouse open, my email, Slack. It's a lot of tab-switching and context-switching. I'd love more integration so I can stay in one place.

**Sophia Kim:** We've also heard from the team that prioritizing candidates within a large result set is challenging. Even with good filters, you might have two hundred potential candidates. How do you know which ones to reach out to first? We need better ways to rank and prioritize.

**Interviewer:** So like, the tool could surface the best matches based on fit?

**Sophia Kim:** Exactly. And ideally, it would show us why it's ranking candidates in that order. We want transparency, not just a magic black box ranking.

**Interviewer:** Got it. What else is on your wishlist for sourcing tools?

**Patricia Chen:** I'd love more automation around outreach and follow-up. Right now, I'm manually copying candidates from Jewel to my email tool, setting up sequences, tracking responses. It would be great if that was all integrated so I could manage the whole workflow in one place.

**Mark Thompson:** Better analytics would be huge. Show me which of my saved filter sets are performing best. Show me which sourcing channels are driving the most hires. Give me data so I can optimize my approach.

**Sophia Kim:** And I'd love better collaboration features. If Patricia finds a candidate who might be a fit for a role Mark is working on, she shouldn't have to manually tag him in Slack. The tool should automatically surface those potential matches.

**Interviewer:** Those are all great suggestions. Let's talk about the competitive landscape for a minute. You mentioned you evaluated a bunch of tools before choosing Jewel. What did you like and dislike about the others?

**Sophia Kim:** SeekOut has a massive database, which is appealing, but the interface is really overwhelming. There are so many options, so many filters, so many toggles. It felt like you'd need weeks of training to use it effectively.

**Patricia Chen:** HireEZ has some interesting features, but when we tested the contact data quality side-by-side, Jewel came out ahead. Jewel's email addresses were more accurate, and the data felt fresher.

**Mark Thompson:** Gem is interesting for the sequencing and automation side, but the search and filtering capabilities didn't feel as robust as Jewel. It's like they're optimized for different parts of the funnel.

**Sophia Kim:** And Juicebox is solid—they were actually a close second for us. They have excellent filtering and saved filter functionality. But Jewel's AI features tipped the scales. The AI intake form in particular was something Juicebox didn't have at the time.

**Interviewer:** So it sounds like the AI capabilities were a key differentiator for you.

**Sophia Kim:** They were. We saw the AI intake form as a force multiplier for the team. It makes everyone more productive, especially newer folks who are still ramping up.

**Interviewer:** Got it. So overall, you're happy with Jewel?

**Sophia Kim:** Yeah, we are. I mean, there are always things we'd like to see improved—no tool is perfect—but overall, it's been a really strong partnership. And we appreciate that the Jewel team is responsive to feedback. We've submitted feature requests, and we've seen some of them get built, which makes us feel like we're partners rather than just customers.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear. Okay, let's talk about the future. Where do you see your sourcing stack evolving over the next year or two?

**Sophia Kim:** I think we'll continue with Jewel as our core sourcing platform. We've invested a lot in it at this point, and it's working well. But I could see us adding some complementary tools for specific use cases. Like, maybe we add something for outreach automation if Jewel doesn't build that, or maybe we add something for diversity-focused sourcing.

**Patricia Chen:** I'd love to see more AI features in Jewel. The AI intake form is great, but there's so much more potential. Like, AI-powered candidate ranking, AI that learns from my behavior and gets smarter over time, AI-powered outreach message generation.

**Mark Thompson:** Yeah, as long as it's transparent and gives us control. I'm not interested in black box AI where I don't understand what it's doing or why. I want AI that augments my work, not replaces my judgment.

**Interviewer:** Right. So AI as a co-pilot, not an autopilot.

**Mark Thompson:** Exactly. I've been recruiting for twelve years. I have good instincts about candidates. I want AI to help me be more efficient and catch things I might have missed, but I don't want to just blindly follow what an AI tells me.

**Interviewer:** That makes a lot of sense. Okay, we're coming up on time, but I have a few more questions. You mentioned that you're trying to scale the persona-based approach across the team. What's the plan for that?

**Sophia Kim:** We're working on building out a persona library. We're documenting Patricia and Mark's personas, and we're going to do training sessions with the rest of the team to teach them how to build their own personas for their role families.

**Patricia Chen:** We're also thinking about how to make personas shareable. Right now, my saved filters are tied to my Jewel account. But it would be great if I could publish them to a team library so other people can use them as starting points.

**Interviewer:** That's a great idea. Have you talked to Jewel about building a feature for that?

**Sophia Kim:** We have, actually. It's one of our top feature requests. We'd love to see a shared persona library where team members can publish their filter sets and others can use them or customize them.

**Patricia Chen:** It would be such a time-saver. Instead of everyone building personas from scratch, they could start with a template and customize it for their specific needs.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Okay, last few questions. If you were talking to a peer at another company who's evaluating their sourcing stack, what advice would you give them?

**Sophia Kim:** I'd say think about the long-term. Don't just choose a tool because it has one cool feature. Think about whether it's going to grow with you, whether the vendor is going to be responsive to your needs, whether the team is actually going to adopt it. Those things matter more than any single feature.

**Patricia Chen:** I'd say prioritize user experience. You're going to be living in this tool every single day. If it's not intuitive and easy to use, your team won't adopt it, and you won't get the ROI you're hoping for.

**Mark Thompson:** I'd say invest in training and best practices. A tool is only as good as how you use it. Spend time developing personas, documenting your approaches, training your team. That's where the real leverage comes from.

**Interviewer:** Great advice. And last question: if we were to reconnect in six months, what would have to be true for you to feel like you've made progress on sourcing?

**Sophia Kim:** I'd want to see our time-to-fill continue to come down, especially for those really hard-to-fill specialized roles. And I'd want to see the persona-based approach fully scaled across the team—everyone using it, not just Patricia and Mark.

**Patricia Chen:** I'd want to see better data quality. Fewer bounced emails, fewer outdated profiles. And I'd love to see more workflow integration so I'm not juggling so many different tools.

**Mark Thompson:** I'd want to feel like we're getting smarter as a recruiting org. Like, we're learning from our data, we're iterating on our approaches, we're continuously improving. That's what great recruiting organizations do.

**Interviewer:** Awesome. Well, thank you all so much for your time today. This has been incredibly valuable. I really appreciate all the specific examples and your thoughtfulness.

**Sophia Kim:** Of course! Happy to help.

**Patricia Chen:** Yeah, anytime. This was fun.

**Mark Thompson:** Thanks for having us. Good luck with your research.

**Interviewer:** Thank you! We'll definitely be in touch.
