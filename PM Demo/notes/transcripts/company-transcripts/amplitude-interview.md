**Interviewer:** Hey Natalie, hey Isaac! Thanks so much for making time today. I know you both have packed schedules, so I really appreciate it.

**Natalie Young:** Of course! Happy to help.

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, no problem. We're always happy to talk about recruiting tools—it's kind of our thing.

**Interviewer:** Ha, I love it. Okay, so just to set the stage, we're doing these conversations to understand how companies are approaching sourcing in 2024. What's working, what's not, what pain points you're dealing with. This is purely learning for us—no sales pitch, I promise. Sound good?

**Isaac Walker:** Sounds perfect.

**Interviewer:** Great. So let's start with some context. Can you give me an overview of Amplitude's recruiting operation? Team size, hiring volume, all that?

**Isaac Walker:** Sure. We have a recruiting team of about ten people right now—that includes recruiters, a couple of sourcers, and recruiting ops. In terms of hiring volume, we're doing probably twenty to twenty-five hires per quarter across all functions. We're definitely more measured than we were a couple years ago, but we're still actively hiring.

**Natalie Young:** And I focus specifically on product roles—product managers, product designers, product analysts. That's probably five to seven hires per quarter for me personally.

**Interviewer:** Got it. And what's your current tech stack? What are you using for ATS and sourcing?

**Isaac Walker:** We're on Greenhouse for our ATS. We've been with them for about four years now. And for sourcing, we're primarily using Jewel, which we adopted maybe eighteen months ago. We also have LinkedIn Recruiter, obviously.

**Natalie Young:** We also have access to Greenhouse's AI sourcing module, which came bundled with our contract, but to be honest, most of us don't use it very much. Jewel is our main sourcing tool.

**Interviewer:** Okay, interesting. So you're a Jewel customer. How did you end up with Jewel?

**Isaac Walker:** We did a vendor evaluation about eighteen months ago. We looked at a handful of sourcing tools—HireEZ, SeekOut, Juicebox, Gem, and Jewel. We ended up choosing Jewel primarily because of the user experience and the AI features.

**Natalie Young:** Yeah, the AI intake form was a big differentiator. It makes starting a new search so much easier. And the overall interface is just really clean and intuitive.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear. How has the experience been over the last eighteen months?

**Isaac Walker:** Overall, really positive. The team adopted it quickly, which is always a good sign. And we're seeing good results—our sourcing metrics have improved across the board.

**Natalie Young:** I personally love it. It's become an essential part of my workflow. I can't imagine going back to how we did things before.

**Interviewer:** That's awesome. Okay, so let's dig in a bit. Natalie, you mentioned you focus on product roles. Can you walk me through your sourcing process for a typical PM role?

**Natalie Young:** Sure. So, okay, let me think of a recent example. We just filled a Senior Product Manager role for our B2B product team. This was a PM who would be working on our enterprise features—things like SSO, permissioning, admin controls, all that.

**Interviewer:** Mmhmm.

**Natalie Young:** So my process usually starts with a deep intake conversation with the hiring manager. What are we really looking for? What's the product area? What's the customer? What skills are must-haves versus nice-to-haves? For this B2B PM role, the must-haves were: experience working on B2B products, preferably in the analytics or SaaS space; strong technical depth—able to work closely with engineers; and experience with enterprise sales cycles.

**Interviewer:** Right.

**Natalie Young:** And then once I have that clarity, I go into Jewel and start building out my search. This is where it gets interesting, because product management is incredibly broad, right? The search strategy for a B2B PM is totally different from the search strategy for a consumer growth PM or a technical/data-heavy PM.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about that. What do you mean by different search strategies?

**Natalie Young:** So for that B2B PM role, I'm filtering for people who've worked at B2B SaaS companies—places like Salesforce, HubSpot, Atlassian, Segment, Mixpanel, Looker. I'm looking for PMs whose descriptions mention "B2B," "enterprise," "admin tools," "permissioning," things like that. And I'm looking for people who have worked closely with sales and customer success teams, because that's a big part of B2B product work.

**Interviewer:** Okay.

**Natalie Young:** But if I were hiring for a consumer growth PM, I'd have a completely different filter set. For that, I'd be looking at companies like Meta, Uber, DoorDash, Airbnb—companies with big consumer bases and strong growth practices. I'd be looking for PMs whose descriptions mention "growth," "experimentation," "A/B testing," "funnel optimization." It's a totally different profile.

**Interviewer:** That's fascinating. So you essentially have different personas for different types of PMs?

**Natalie Young:** Exactly. And I've saved these as filter sets in Jewel so I can pull them up whenever I need them. It's been a huge time-saver because I'm not reinventing the wheel every time. I have my B2B PM persona, my consumer growth PM persona, my technical/data-heavy PM persona, and a couple others.

**Interviewer:** How many personas do you have total?

**Natalie Young:** Let me think... I have four main ones. The B2B PM persona, the consumer growth PM persona, the technical/data-heavy PM persona—that's for PMs who are more like product engineers, very technical—and then I have one for platform/API PMs, which is for PMs who work on developer-facing products.

**Isaac Walker:** Natalie has really pioneered this approach on our team, and we're now trying to scale it to other role families. We're seeing that this persona-based thinking is relevant for engineering roles, design roles, really any role family where there's a lot of diversity within the function.

**Interviewer:** That's really interesting. Isaac, when you look at Natalie's results compared to other recruiters on the team, what are you seeing?

**Isaac Walker:** Natalie's hit rates are consistently higher—both in terms of response rates and in terms of candidates actually being a good fit when they enter the process. I think a big part of that is because she's being so targeted. She's not just blasting out to anyone with "product manager" in their title. She's really thinking about the persona and matching it to the role.

**Natalie Young:** Yeah, and candidates notice that. I've had people reply and say, "This actually seems relevant to my background," which sounds basic, but you'd be surprised how much generic recruiting spam is out there.

**Interviewer:** Absolutely. Okay, so let's talk about Jewel specifically. You mentioned the AI intake form was a key differentiator. How are you using that feature?

**Natalie Young:** I use it pretty much every time I start a new search. Basically, instead of manually building out all the filters, I just have a conversation with the AI. It asks me questions like, "What's the role? What skills are required? What companies should we target? What's the seniority level?" And based on my answers, it builds out the search parameters for me.

**Interviewer:** And how accurate is it? Does it usually get it right?

**Natalie Young:** It's pretty good. I'd say like eighty to ninety percent of the time, it nails it on the first try. And when it doesn't, I can just tweak the filters manually. The nice thing is that it's transparent—I can see all the filters it applied, so I'm not just blindly trusting a black box.

**Isaac Walker:** For newer recruiters especially, the AI intake form has been a game-changer. It helps them ramp up faster because they don't need to be experts in Boolean search or advanced filtering right out of the gate. The AI guides them through the process.

**Interviewer:** That's really interesting. So it's almost like a training tool as well as a productivity tool.

**Isaac Walker:** Exactly. And it creates more consistency across the team. Everyone's using a similar methodology to build their searches, which means the quality of our sourcing is more consistent.

**Interviewer:** Got it. Okay, let's talk about the other tools you mentioned. You said you have access to Greenhouse AI sourcing but don't use it much. Why is that?

**Natalie Young:** I gave it a try for a few weeks, but I just didn't stick with it. The main issue was that the results weren't as good as what I could get from Jewel. The candidates it was suggesting felt too generic.

**Interviewer:** Can you give me an example?

**Natalie Young:** Sure. So I was hiring for that technical/data-heavy PM role—someone who could work really closely with data scientists and engineers, who understood SQL and data modeling, that kind of thing. I put the role into Greenhouse AI, and it gave me back a bunch of general product managers. Some of them were from analytics companies, which was good, but they didn't have the technical depth I was looking for. The AI was making surface-level matches rather than understanding the nuance.

**Isaac Walker:** And the other issue is just the UX. It feels like Greenhouse AI was tacked onto Greenhouse rather than being natively integrated. It's a separate tab, separate workflow. It doesn't fit smoothly into how we work.

**Interviewer:** Right. So it sounds like integration and workflow are important to you.

**Isaac Walker:** Hugely important. We're using these tools all day, every day. If something doesn't fit into our workflow, it's adding friction, and we're less likely to use it.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Okay, let's talk about pain points more broadly. What are the biggest challenges you're facing in sourcing right now?

**Natalie Young:** The biggest one for me is data staleness. Contact data goes stale so quickly, especially in tech. Someone changes companies, their email changes, and we don't know about it until we reach out and the email bounces. It's frustrating.

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, that's a consistent pain point. We're paying for contact data, but if it's not accurate, it's not adding value. And it makes us look sloppy to candidates, which is not great for our employer brand.

**Natalie Young:** The other pain point is just the volume of candidates. Even with good filters, I'm often dealing with hundreds of potential candidates for a single role. It would be great to have better ways to prioritize or rank candidates so I'm starting with the best matches.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. So like, the tool could surface the top candidates based on fit?

**Natalie Young:** Exactly. And ideally, it would show me why it thinks those candidates are the best fits. What signals is it looking at? I want transparency, not just a black box ranking.

**Isaac Walker:** I'd also say that outreach and follow-up is still pretty manual. We're using Jewel for sourcing, but then we have to copy candidates over to our email tool, set up sequences, track responses. It would be great to have more of that workflow integrated into Jewel.

**Interviewer:** Got it. So more automation around the outreach piece. Have you looked at other tools that do that?

**Isaac Walker:** We've looked at Gem, which has good sequencing and automation features. But adding another tool means more cost, more training, more complexity. Ideally, Jewel would just build those features so we don't need a separate tool.

**Natalie Young:** Yeah, I'd love to have everything in one place. Right now, I'm toggling between Jewel, my email, Greenhouse, LinkedIn. It's a lot of context-switching.

**Interviewer:** Right. So consolidation would be valuable. What else is on your wishlist?

**Natalie Young:** Better analytics. I'd love to know which of my saved filter sets are performing best. Which sourcing channels are driving the most hires. Show me the data so I can optimize my approach.

**Isaac Walker:** I'd love better collaboration features. Right now, if Natalie finds a candidate who might be a fit for an engineering role, she has to manually share that with the engineering recruiter. It would be great if the tool could automatically suggest, "Hey, this candidate might also be relevant for this other role."

**Natalie Young:** And I'd love if the tool could learn from my behavior over time. If I keep selecting certain types of candidates and passing on others, the AI should learn those patterns and adjust its recommendations.

**Interviewer:** Those are all great suggestions. Let's talk about the competitive landscape for a minute. You mentioned you evaluated several tools before choosing Jewel. What did you like and dislike about the others?

**Isaac Walker:** SeekOut has a massive database, which is appealing. But the interface is really complex. There are so many options and settings—it felt overwhelming. We felt like we'd need extensive training to use it effectively.

**Natalie Young:** HireEZ has some interesting features, but the contact data quality wasn't as good as Jewel's when we tested. We did side-by-side comparisons, and Jewel's email accuracy was consistently higher.

**Isaac Walker:** Juicebox is solid—we almost went with them. They have great filtering and saved filter functionality. But Jewel's AI intake form was the tiebreaker. That feature really accelerated our team's productivity.

**Interviewer:** So it sounds like the AI intake form was a big decision factor.

**Natalie Young:** It was. It's one of those features that seems small, but in practice, it's a huge time-saver. And it makes the whole team more effective, especially newer folks.

**Interviewer:** Got it. So overall, you're happy with Jewel?

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, we are. I mean, no tool is perfect, and there are definitely things we'd like to see improved. But overall, it's been a good partnership. And we feel like the Jewel team listens to our feedback, which is important to us.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear. Okay, let's talk about the future. Where do you see your sourcing stack going in the next year or two?

**Isaac Walker:** I think we'll continue with Jewel as our primary sourcing platform. We're pretty invested at this point, and it's working well. But I could see us adding complementary tools for specific use cases—like maybe something for outreach automation if Jewel doesn't build that, or maybe something for diversity sourcing.

**Natalie Young:** I'd love to see Jewel add more AI features. The AI intake form is great, but there's so much more AI could do. Like, AI-powered candidate ranking, AI-powered message generation, AI that learns from my behavior and gets smarter over time.

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, as long as it's transparent and gives us control. We're not interested in black box AI that just tells us what to do. We want AI that augments our judgment, not replaces it.

**Interviewer:** Right. So AI as a co-pilot rather than an autopilot.

**Isaac Walker:** Exactly. We've got experienced recruiters who have good instincts. We want AI to help them be more efficient and catch things they might have missed, but we don't want to just blindly follow an AI's recommendations.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Okay, we're coming up on time, but I have a few more questions. You mentioned that you're trying to scale Natalie's persona-based approach to other role families. What's the plan for that?

**Isaac Walker:** We're documenting Natalie's process and her personas, and then we're going to do training sessions with the rest of the team. The goal is to get everyone thinking in terms of personas rather than generic role categories.

**Natalie Young:** We're also thinking about building out a shared library of personas that the whole team can access. Like, I could publish my PM personas so that if someone else needs to recruit for a PM role, they can use my filter sets as a starting point.

**Interviewer:** That's a great idea. Have you thought about whether Jewel could help with this? Like, could they provide a feature for sharing personas across teams?

**Natalie Young:** Oh, that would be amazing. Right now, saved filters are tied to individual accounts. But if there was a way to share them across the team or even publish them to a team library, that would be super valuable.

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, that's actually a feature request we've submitted to Jewel. We'd love to see that.

**Interviewer:** Good to know. Okay, last few questions. If you were talking to a peer at another company who's evaluating their sourcing stack, what advice would you give them?

**Natalie Young:** I'd say prioritize ease of use and UX. You're going to be living in this tool every day. If it's clunky or confusing, it's going to slow you down, and your team won't adopt it.

**Isaac Walker:** I'd say look for tools that have strong AI features but are also transparent. Black box AI is scary. You want to understand what the AI is doing and be able to guide it. And I'd say think about the full workflow, not just the search piece. Sourcing is end-to-end—it's search, outreach, follow-up, analytics. Make sure your tool supports the whole workflow.

**Natalie Young:** And I'd say invest in building out personas for your role families. It takes time upfront, but it pays off in the long run. The more targeted you can be, the better your results will be.

**Interviewer:** Great advice. And last question: if we were to reconnect in six months, what would have to be true for you to feel like you've made progress on sourcing?

**Isaac Walker:** I'd want to see our time-to-fill come down, especially for those hard-to-fill niche roles. And I'd want to see the persona-based approach adopted across the whole team, not just Natalie.

**Natalie Young:** I'd want to see better data quality—fewer bounced emails, fewer outdated profiles. And I'd want to see more workflow integration so I'm not juggling so many different tools.

**Isaac Walker:** And I'd want to feel like we're getting smarter as a team. Like, we're learning from our sourcing data, we're iterating on our approaches, we're getting more efficient over time.

**Interviewer:** Awesome. Well, thank you both so much for your time. This has been really insightful. I appreciate all the specific examples and your candor.

**Natalie Young:** Of course! Happy to help.

**Isaac Walker:** Yeah, anytime. This was a great conversation.

**Interviewer:** Thanks! We'll definitely be in touch.
