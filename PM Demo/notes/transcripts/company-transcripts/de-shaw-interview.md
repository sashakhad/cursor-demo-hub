## Opening

**Interviewer**: Thanks so much for making time today. I know you're all busy, so I appreciate you fitting this into your schedules. Maybe we could start with quick introductions?

**Lisa Wang (Head of Technology Recruiting)**: Sure, happy to. I'm Lisa Wang, I head up technology recruiting at DE Shaw. I've been with the firm for about ten years now - started as an individual contributor recruiter and moved into leadership about four years ago. I oversee our technology recruiting globally, which is about 20 recruiters across New York, London, Hong Kong, and Hyderabad.

**Andrew Foster (Senior Recruiter - Quantitative Research)**: Andrew Foster. I'm a Senior Recruiter focused on quantitative research and systematic trading roles. I've been at DE Shaw for six years. Before this I was at Renaissance Technologies, so I have some background in quantitative finance recruiting.

**Maria Santos (Campus Recruiting Manager)**: Hi, Maria Santos. I manage our campus recruiting program. I've been here for four years. Campus recruiting is a huge part of our hiring strategy - we recruit heavily from top computer science and mathematics programs.

**Interviewer**: Great context. Can you give me a sense of your hiring volume?

**Lisa Wang**: We're hiring probably 200 to 250 people annually across the firm. Of that, maybe 60% are technology roles - software engineers, data scientists, systems engineers, security roles. Another 20% are quantitative research and trading. The rest is operations, business strategy, client service.

**Andrew Foster**: On the quant research side, we're filling maybe 40 to 50 roles per year. Not a massive volume, but very high touch, very selective.

**Maria Santos**: Campus hires are probably 40 to 45% of our total volume. We're at about 15 to 20 universities every year doing on-campus recruiting, career fairs, info sessions. It's a big investment but it's core to our talent strategy.

**Interviewer**: What does your current recruiting tech stack look like?

**Lisa Wang**: We have a custom internal ATS that was built probably 12 years ago. It's... functional. It handles our applicant tracking needs, but it's definitely showing its age. There have been discussions about replacing it, but that's a massive undertaking. For sourcing, we're using LinkedIn Recruiter universally - every recruiter has a license. And we've been using Jewel for about 18 months now, specifically for some of our software engineering recruiting.

**Interviewer**: So you're already a Jewel customer. How did that come about?

**Lisa Wang**: We piloted it initially with a few recruiters on my team who were recruiting for software engineering roles. The feedback was positive - they liked the filtering capabilities, the UI was cleaner than LinkedIn, the analytics were helpful. So we expanded it to about half the technology recruiting team. We haven't rolled it out to quant research yet or to campus recruiting.

**Andrew Foster**: I've seen demos of it but haven't used it myself. I'm still primarily on LinkedIn for my sourcing.

**Maria Santos**: Same here. Campus recruiting has different needs, so we haven't really explored whether Jewel would be applicable for us.

## Current State Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about how recruiting works today. Lisa, can you walk me through a typical software engineering hire?

**Lisa Wang**: Sure. So we hire software engineers for several different areas of the firm - our core trading systems, our research platform, our data infrastructure, our client-facing technology, internal tools. Each of those has somewhat different requirements.

Let's say we're hiring for the trading systems team. That's our low-latency, high-performance systems that execute trades. These folks need to be exceptional programmers - usually C++ - with deep understanding of systems programming, low-latency optimization, concurrent programming. They need to think about microsecond-level performance.

**Interviewer**: What's your sourcing approach for that profile?

**Lisa Wang**: So I'm looking for candidates with C++ expertise, but not just any C++ developers - I need people who have experience with low-latency systems. So I'm filtering for keywords like "low-latency," "high-frequency trading," "microsecond optimization," "lock-free programming," "cache optimization." I'm looking at companies like Citadel, Jump Trading, Tower Research, IMC, other high-frequency trading firms. I'm looking at exchange technology companies. Maybe some candidates from tech companies that do low-latency work like Google or Facebook infrastructure teams.

**Interviewer**: How are you using Jewel versus LinkedIn for these searches?

**Lisa Wang**: Honestly, for the low-latency C++ roles, I've been using LinkedIn more because I have my search strategies already built there. The recruiters who are using Jewel have told me it's good for building complex searches, but I haven't made the migration myself yet.

**Interviewer**: What other technology personas do you recruit for?

**Lisa Wang**: We hire a lot of machine learning engineers - folks who are building ML models for systematic trading strategies, for NLP on alternative data, for portfolio optimization. Those folks need strong ML backgrounds - deep learning, NLP, reinforcement learning - plus solid engineering skills to build production systems.

**Andrew Foster**: The ML engineers are interesting because they sit between technology and quantitative research. They need both engineering rigor and research creativity.

**Lisa Wang**: Exactly. So for ML engineers, I'm looking for strong academic backgrounds - often PhDs in computer science or related fields - publications in ML conferences, experience at companies with strong ML practices. Keywords shift to "machine learning," "deep learning," "NLP," "computer vision," "PyTorch," "TensorFlow." Companies shift to Google, Facebook, OpenAI, places with cutting-edge ML work.

**Interviewer**: Andrew, can you walk me through how you source for quantitative research roles?

**Andrew Foster**: Yeah, so quantitative research at DE Shaw is quite broad. We have people developing systematic trading strategies, people doing fundamental research enhanced by quantitative methods, people building models for portfolio construction, risk management researchers. The backgrounds vary significantly.

Let me give you a specific example. We recently hired a quantitative developer for our systematic trading team. This person is implementing trading strategies that our researchers have developed - they're writing code that actually executes the trades, they're optimizing performance, they're ensuring everything is production-quality.

**Interviewer**: What background were you looking for?

**Andrew Foster**: Strong programming skills - C++ primarily - but also deep understanding of quantitative methods. Often these folks have master's or PhDs in computer science, mathematics, or physics. They might have worked at other quantitative hedge funds, they might be coming from tech companies with strong quantitative work, or they might be coming from academia.

**Lisa Wang**: The keywords for quantitative developers are different from the low-latency engineers I described earlier.

**Andrew Foster**: Right. I'm looking for "quantitative trading," "systematic trading," "alpha generation," "backtesting," statistical analysis keywords. I'm looking at other hedge funds - Renaissance, Citadel, Two Sigma, Millennium. I'm looking at candidates who've done quantitative work at tech companies. The search is quite different from a pure low-latency engineering search.

**Interviewer**: How many different quant research personas are you managing?

**Andrew Foster**: At least four or five major ones, each with different search strategies.

**Maria Santos**: On the campus side, we're looking for top students from top programs. MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, CMU - we have deep relationships at maybe 15 to 20 universities. We're recruiting new grads for software engineering roles, quantitative research roles, and some business roles.

**Interviewer**: How do you identify the right students?

**Maria Santos**: We attend career fairs, we do on-campus presentations, we reach out to professors, we work with student organizations. And we do some sourcing on LinkedIn - looking at students at target universities, often filtering by major, graduation year, relevant coursework or projects. But it's much more relationship-driven than experienced hire recruiting.

**Interviewer**: What's working well with your current tech stack?

**Lisa Wang**: The recruiters using Jewel have had positive experiences. They like the filtering capabilities, they like the saved search functionality, they like the analytics showing which sources are most effective. The UI is more modern than LinkedIn.

**Andrew Foster**: LinkedIn has broad reach and everyone knows how to use it. For general searches it's fine.

**Maria Santos**: Our internal ATS handles the basics - applicant tracking, interview scheduling, offer management. It's clunky but it works.

## Pain Points Exploration

**Interviewer**: Let's dig into the challenges. Andrew, you mentioned multiple quant research personas. Can you walk me through all of them?

**Andrew Foster**: Sure. So I'd categorize our quantitative research roles into four or five major personas.

First, you have C++ low-latency engineers who are building the core trading infrastructure. These folks are as much engineers as they are quants. They need exceptional C++ skills - modern C++, template metaprogramming, low-latency optimization - deep understanding of computer systems, and enough quantitative knowledge to work closely with researchers. They're often coming from other quantitative trading firms or from tech companies with high-performance systems.

**Lisa Wang**: And the search criteria is very systems-focused - C++, low-latency, high-frequency trading, microsecond performance, that kind of thing.

**Andrew Foster**: Right. Companies are Citadel, Jump, Tower, Hudson River Trading, maybe Google or Facebook infrastructure teams. Education is usually strong CS programs.

The second major persona is machine learning researchers - these are folks with deep ML expertise who are applying cutting-edge ML techniques to trading strategies, alternative data, portfolio optimization. They need PhD-level knowledge of machine learning - often they've published papers - plus understanding of financial markets and ability to translate research into production systems.

**Interviewer**: And they're coming from different places?

**Andrew Foster**: Often from academia - PhD students or postdocs looking to move to industry. Or from tech companies with strong ML research teams - Google Brain, DeepMind, Facebook AI Research, OpenAI. Or from other quantitative hedge funds that do ML work - Two Sigma, Citadel, Renaissance.

**Lisa Wang**: The search shifts to machine learning keywords - "deep learning," "NLP," "reinforcement learning," publications in NeurIPS or ICML, those kinds of signals.

**Andrew Foster**: Exactly. The third persona is quantitative developers who are implementing systematic trading strategies. I mentioned this role earlier - they're writing production code for trading strategies that researchers have developed. They need both strong programming skills and solid quantitative background.

Often these folks have master's or PhDs in quantitative fields - mathematics, physics, statistics, computer science - and they've either worked at other quant funds or they're coming from tech companies where they've done quantitative work. The search is looking for programming skills plus quantitative skills - C++ or Python, "systematic trading," "alpha generation," "backtesting," statistical analysis.

**Lisa Wang**: And companies shift to other hedge funds primarily, or quantitative roles at tech companies.

**Andrew Foster**: Right. The fourth major persona is systematic trading engineers who are building the infrastructure for our systematic strategies - the backtesting frameworks, the research platforms, the data pipelines that feed our strategies. These are more engineering-focused but they need to understand quantitative trading deeply to build the right infrastructure.

**Interviewer**: So they're building tools for researchers?

**Andrew Foster**: Exactly. They need strong software engineering skills, understanding of systematic trading workflows, data engineering capabilities, and enough quantitative knowledge to work with researchers effectively. Often they're coming from other quant funds, or from tech companies with strong data science infrastructure.

**Lisa Wang**: The search is a mix of engineering and quantitative trading keywords.

**Andrew Foster**: Yeah, "data engineering," "research infrastructure," "backtesting," "systematic trading," "Python," "Spark," maybe "quantitative finance." It's a hybrid search.

**Interviewer**: So four distinct personas just within quantitative research?

**Andrew Foster**: At least four major ones, and there are sub-variations within each. For example, within ML researchers, someone focused on NLP for alternative data is different from someone focused on reinforcement learning for execution algorithms.

**Lisa Wang**: We have the same challenge in technology. Let me walk through data engineering specifically since that's a big area for us.

Within data engineers, I'd say there are three major personas. First, data infrastructure engineers who are building our data platforms - the systems that ingest, store, and process massive amounts of market data, alternative data, fundamental data. These folks need distributed systems expertise, big data technologies like Spark and Kafka, database systems, strong systems programming skills.

**Interviewer**: And where do they come from?

**Lisa Wang**: Tech companies with scale data challenges - Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Uber. Or from data infrastructure companies like Databricks or Confluent. The search is very infrastructure-focused - "distributed systems," "data infrastructure," "Spark," "Kafka," "data lake," "data warehouse."

Second persona is analytics engineers who are building data models and analytics that our researchers and traders use. They need SQL expertise, data modeling skills, understanding of analytics workflows, and crucially - understanding of finance and trading. They're often coming from financial services firms - other hedge funds, banks, asset managers.

**Andrew Foster**: These folks need to understand our domain to build useful analytics.

**Lisa Wang**: Exactly. So the search shifts - still data engineering, but now with finance keywords - "financial data," "market data," "analytics," "SQL," "data modeling," maybe "Bloomberg" or other financial data tools.

The third persona is ML platform engineers who are building the infrastructure that supports our machine learning research - model training infrastructure, feature stores, model deployment systems, ML monitoring. They need infrastructure engineering skills plus deep understanding of ML workflows.

**Interviewer**: And they're typically coming from tech companies?

**Lisa Wang**: Usually companies with mature ML platforms - Google, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb. Or AI-first companies. The search is "ML infrastructure," "MLOps," "model deployment," "feature engineering," "TensorFlow," "PyTorch."

**Interviewer**: So you're managing dozens of distinct personas across technology and quant research?

**Lisa Wang**: Easily. And each one requires a different search strategy. Right now, I have search strings saved in a document, some of my team is using Jewel's saved search functionality, some are rebuilding searches each time. It's not systematic.

**Andrew Foster**: Same on my side. I have search strategies that have been refined over six years, but they're not documented in a way that others can easily leverage. If I left tomorrow, that knowledge walks out the door.

**Interviewer**: How much time are you spending managing these searches?

**Andrew Foster**: Probably three to five hours a week just building and refining searches. Every new req requires thinking about which persona it maps to, pulling up the relevant search criteria, adjusting for the specific role, testing, iterating.

**Lisa Wang**: And it's inefficient. We should be able to leverage searches across the team, but we don't have good systems for that.

**Maria Santos**: Campus recruiting has different challenges. We're less focused on complex searches and more focused on relationship management - tracking which students we've talked to, which schools we're prioritizing, coordinating info sessions and interviews. Our tools don't really support that workflow well.

**Interviewer**: What other pain points are you experiencing?

**Lisa Wang**: Email deliverability is always a challenge. We see bounce rates of 15 to 20%, which is frustrating when you're reaching out to a small pool of specialized candidates.

**Andrew Foster**: And LinkedIn data goes stale. Someone's profile says they're at Two Sigma but they moved to Citadel nine months ago. We're wasting time on outdated information.

**Lisa Wang**: We also lack integrated analytics. Jewel has some good analytics features that the recruiters using it like, but it's not comprehensive across all our sourcing. I can't easily answer questions like: Which sourcing strategies yield the best candidates? Which companies are the best sources? How does candidate quality vary by source?

## Competitive Landscape

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about the competitive landscape. You're already using Jewel for part of your recruiting. What prompted that decision?

**Lisa Wang**: We'd been hearing good things about Jewel from peers in the industry. Two Sigma uses it, I believe Citadel has piloted it. We wanted something more sophisticated than LinkedIn for complex searches. So we did a pilot with a few recruiters about 18 months ago.

**Interviewer**: What was the feedback from the pilot?

**Lisa Wang**: Positive overall. The recruiters liked the filtering capabilities - being able to build complex searches with multiple criteria and save them. They liked the UI, which is more modern than LinkedIn. They liked the analytics showing which sources were performing well. The data quality seemed comparable to LinkedIn.

**Interviewer**: Why haven't you rolled it out more broadly?

**Lisa Wang**: A few reasons. One, change management - getting recruiters to shift from tools they know to new tools takes time and training. Two, we wanted to validate the ROI before making a bigger investment. Three, we're not sure how well it would work for Andrew's quant research recruiting or Maria's campus recruiting.

**Andrew Foster**: I haven't had a strong reason to switch from LinkedIn yet. I know the tool, I have my workflows established. If Jewel can demonstrably make me more effective, I'm open to it, but I need to see that value.

**Maria Santos**: Campus recruiting is different enough that I'm not sure Jewel would be applicable. We're not doing a ton of Boolean searches for students - we're more focused on relationships and pipeline management.

**Interviewer**: What other tools have you evaluated?

**Lisa Wang**: We looked at Gem, which is focused on outbound engagement and sequencing. We decided it wasn't the right fit - we needed better sourcing capabilities first, then we could think about engagement optimization.

**Andrew Foster**: We've looked at some of the newer AI sourcing tools - I forget the names - but they seemed too "black box" for me. I want to understand why a candidate is being surfaced, I want control over the criteria.

**Lisa Wang**: We've also considered whether to rebuild our internal ATS and add sourcing capabilities. But honestly, recruiting tools aren't our core competency. We should be buying best-of-breed tools and integrating them, not building from scratch.

**Interviewer**: What would make you expand Jewel usage to more of the team?

**Lisa Wang**: A few things. First, demonstrating clear ROI from the current users - are they more efficient, are they finding better candidates, are they filling roles faster? Second, understanding how it would work for Andrew's quant research recruiting specifically - can it handle that complexity? Third, better integration with our internal ATS so we're not managing candidates in two separate systems.

**Andrew Foster**: For me, it's about whether it can handle the persona complexity I described. If I can build a library of sophisticated searches for all my different quant research profiles, and easily switch between them or modify them, that would be valuable. If it's just a fancier version of LinkedIn, I'm not sure it's worth the switch.

**Lisa Wang**: And we'd want to see references from other quantitative finance firms using it successfully. Are there other hedge funds recruiting for similar specialized roles who are seeing good results?

## Future Needs & Closing

**Interviewer**: As you think about the ideal state for recruiting at DE Shaw, what would that look like?

**Lisa Wang**: I want consistent, sophisticated sourcing across the team. Every recruiter should have access to optimized search strategies for every persona we recruit for. When someone new joins the team, they should be able to leverage years of institutional knowledge from day one, not start from scratch.

**Andrew Foster**: For me, it's about reusability and refinement. I want to build these complex searches once, save them, and continuously refine them as I learn what works. I want to share those with colleagues and benefit from their learning too.

**Maria Santos**: I'd love better relationship management tools. Campus recruiting is all about tracking relationships over time - with students, with professors, with career services offices. Right now we're managing that in spreadsheets and email.

**Lisa Wang**: Better analytics would be huge too. I want to understand what's working and what's not across all our sourcing efforts. Which strategies yield the best hires? Which companies are the best sources? How do different outreach approaches perform?

**Interviewer**: What would it take for you to expand Jewel usage to the full team?

**Lisa Wang**: We'd need to see continued positive results from the current users - ideally with some quantitative metrics around efficiency gains or candidate quality improvement. We'd want to understand how it works for Andrew's quant research recruiting specifically. And we'd want to see seamless integration with our ATS so we're not creating more work for recruiters.

**Andrew Foster**: I'd want a hands-on trial period. Let me use it for a few months on real searches, see how it performs compared to LinkedIn, measure whether I'm finding better candidates or finding them faster.

**Lisa Wang**: We'd also want references from similar firms - other quantitative hedge funds or systematically-oriented asset managers who are using it for specialized recruiting.

**Interviewer**: What's your timeline for making decisions on recruiting tools?

**Lisa Wang**: We're always evaluating and refining. For expanding Jewel specifically, I'd say we're a few months out from a decision. We want to collect more data from the current users, we want to understand the ROI, and we want to explore whether it makes sense for Andrew's use cases and potentially Maria's.

**Andrew Foster**: I'd be open to trying it in the next quarter if we can set up a trial period.

**Interviewer**: What about budget? How do you think about investing in recruiting tools?

**Lisa Wang**: We're currently spending maybe $80,000 annually on LinkedIn Recruiter, plus the partial Jewel spend. We're fortunate that recruiting is viewed as important and we have reasonable budget. If we can demonstrate that a tool makes us more effective - faster time-to-fill, better candidate quality, more efficient recruiters - we can usually get budget approved.

**Andrew Foster**: The ROI calculation is pretty straightforward. If a tool saves each recruiter five hours a week, that's 250 hours per year per recruiter. Multiply that by 20 recruiters, that's 5,000 hours annually. At our internal cost rates, that's significant value.

**Lisa Wang**: Or if it helps us fill critical roles faster - getting a talented quantitative researcher or machine learning engineer hired two months earlier has real economic value to the firm.

**Interviewer**: This has been really helpful. I appreciate you sharing your experiences with Jewel so far and being candid about what would make you expand usage. Is there anything else I should understand?

**Andrew Foster**: I'd just emphasize that recruiting for quantitative finance is highly specialized. The folks we're looking for are rare - there might be a few dozen or a few hundred qualified candidates globally for a given role. The tool needs to be sophisticated enough to handle that complexity and rare enough profiles.

**Lisa Wang**: And integration is really important. We can't have recruiters spending time on data entry or managing candidates in multiple systems. The tool needs to fit into our workflows, not create new work.

**Maria Santos**: I'd be curious to explore whether Jewel could support campus recruiting workflows at some point. That might be outside the core use case, but if it could, that would be valuable.

**Interviewer**: Great feedback. Let me follow up with a few things - we can arrange for Andrew to do a trial with his quant research recruiting, I can provide case studies and references from other quantitative finance firms, and we can discuss the ATS integration in more technical detail. Does that sound helpful?

**Lisa Wang**: That would be great. Definitely interested in the trial for Andrew and in references from similar firms.

**Andrew Foster**: Yeah, I'd be happy to test it out.

**Interviewer**: Perfect. Thanks again for your time, everyone.

**Lisa Wang**: Thanks, David.

**Andrew Foster**: Thank you.

**Maria Santos**: Thanks.
