**Interviewer:** Thanks so much for joining today. I know you're all busy, so I really appreciate the time. Let's start with quick intros. Victoria, you want to go first?

**Victoria Barnes (Senior Recruiting Manager):** Sure. I'm Victoria, I've been at Plaid for just over three years now. I manage the technical recruiting team, which is about 12 people. We hire for all technical roles - engineering, product, data science, developer relations. Plaid's been growing pretty fast, so it's been a really dynamic environment.

**Ryan Mitchell (Technical Recruiter - Platform):** I'm Ryan, I've been here for about a year and a half. I focus mostly on developer experience roles - so developer advocates, solutions engineers, folks who work on our API docs and SDKs, that kind of thing. Before Plaid, I was at Twilio, so I've been in the API/developer tools space for a few years.

**Sophie Turner (Recruiting Coordinator & Operations):** Hi, I'm Sophie. I've been at Plaid for two years. I started as a recruiting coordinator, and about six months ago I transitioned to more of an operations focus. So now I handle our recruiting tools, data and reporting, process documentation. I make sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.

**Interviewer:** Great. Victoria, can you give me a sense of the hiring volume you're managing?

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, so we're filling about 35 to 40 technical roles per quarter right now. That's a mix of engineering, product, design, data science, and developer relations. Engineering is the majority - probably 25 to 30 of those are engineering roles. We've been at this pace for the last couple quarters. Last year we were a bit higher, like 50 per quarter, but we've been more selective recently. Quality over quantity.

**Ryan Mitchell:** And the roles are pretty diverse, even within engineering. We've got backend engineers, frontend engineers, mobile engineers, security, infrastructure. And then on the developer experience side, which is what I mostly work on, we have developer advocates, solutions engineers, API integration specialists. They're all technical roles, but the profiles are really different.

**Interviewer:** That's interesting. Tell me more about those different developer experience personas.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Sure. So developer advocates are people who are going to create content, speak at conferences, engage with our developer community. They need to be technical enough to understand our product and write code samples, but they also need strong communication skills, writing ability, maybe some design sense. I'm looking for people who've written technical blog posts, given talks, built demo apps. They're like the public face of our developer platform.

**Sophie Turner:** Ryan's developer advocates are like mini celebrities. *laughs*

**Ryan Mitchell:** *laughs* Some of them, yeah. But then we also have solutions engineer roles, which are pretty different. Solutions engineers are more on the sales side - they're doing technical demos, answering prospect questions, helping with integration during the sales process. They need strong technical skills, but they also need sales aptitude, they need to be good at reading the room and understanding customer needs. It's like a blend of engineer and salesperson.

**Victoria Barnes:** And then there's a third category, right? The API integration specialists?

**Ryan Mitchell:** Right, yeah. API integration specialists are more focused on helping customers after they've signed up. They're troubleshooting integration issues, helping customers optimize their implementation, writing custom code for complex use cases. It's less about sales and more about deep technical problem-solving. I'm looking for people with strong coding skills, API expertise, maybe some support or customer success background.

**Interviewer:** So three distinct personas within developer experience roles.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Exactly. And they require completely different sourcing approaches. Like, for developer advocates, I'm looking on Twitter, GitHub, dev.to, places where technical content creators hang out. For solutions engineers, I might look at people from other developer-tools companies - Twilio, Stripe, Segment. For API specialists, I'm looking at people with backend engineering backgrounds who like working directly with customers.

**Interviewer:** That's really interesting. So how do you handle that in your sourcing setup today? Walk me through your tools.

**Sophie Turner:** So we use Greenhouse as our ATS. We've been on Greenhouse for probably four years. For sourcing, we have Jewel, which most of the team uses. We have LinkedIn Recruiter for everyone. And we technically have Greenhouse AI sourcing credits, but I don't think anyone really uses those anymore.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, the Greenhouse sourcing didn't work out for us.

**Interviewer:** What happened with that?

**Ryan Mitchell:** The data was too stale. I tried it maybe a year ago when it first came out, and the email bounce rates were ridiculous. Like, 35 to 40% of emails would bounce. I'd find someone who looked perfect, write a thoughtful message, and then it wouldn't get delivered because they'd changed jobs six months ago. After a few weeks of that, I just gave up on it.

**Sophie Turner:** Yeah, I looked at the data. Our bounce rate with Greenhouse sourcing was 36%. With Jewel it's more like 11%. So there's a massive difference in data quality.

**Victoria Barnes:** And it's frustrating because those credits are bundled into our Greenhouse contract. We're paying for them whether we use them or not. But if they don't deliver results, people won't use them, you know?

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. So most people use Jewel for sourcing now?

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, I live in Jewel. I've been using it probably since I joined Plaid. For the kind of recruiting I do, I couldn't function without it. The saved search functionality is essential.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about how you're using saved searches.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Okay, so like I mentioned, I recruit for these three different developer experience personas, and they each require totally different searches. For developer advocates, I have a saved search that's looking for people with content creation backgrounds. I'm filtering for people who've worked at companies like Twilio, Stripe, Auth0, companies known for good developer relations. I'm looking for people who've written blog posts, spoken at conferences, built open source projects. I might look for keywords like "developer advocate," "developer evangelist," "community manager" in technical communities. That's a very specific profile.

**Interviewer:** And you've built that out as a saved search?

**Ryan Mitchell:** Exactly. And then I have a completely different saved search for solutions engineers. For those roles, I'm looking for people with sales engineering or pre-sales backgrounds. Companies like Stripe, Segment, Datadog, where solutions engineering is a really strong function. I'm filtering for skills like technical demos, API knowledge, maybe some coding ability but not necessarily deep engineering. I want people who can talk to both technical and business stakeholders. That's a different search entirely.

**Sophie Turner:** And then he has the API integration specialist searches, which are different again.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Right. For API specialists, I'm looking for people with backend engineering skills who've worked on integrations or APIs. Maybe people who've been in support engineering roles or developer success roles. Companies like Salesforce, Box, Shopify, where they have big partner ecosystems and lots of custom integrations. I'm looking for people who can code but who also enjoy the customer interaction side. It's like a hybrid engineer-customer success role.

**Interviewer:** So you've built out these three distinct search profiles.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, and within each of those, I have variations. Like, I might have one search for senior developer advocates and another for more junior folks. Or one search for solutions engineers with fintech experience versus general SaaS. So I probably have like 10 or 12 different saved searches total for all my roles. And being able to save them and pull them up whenever I need them is huge. I'm not recreating the wheel every time.

**Victoria Barnes:** And Ryan's really mastered this. He's one of our top performers in terms of hire counts and candidate quality. But not everyone on the team is at that level yet.

**Interviewer:** Is that a challenge? Getting everyone up to speed with this approach?

**Victoria Barnes:** It is. Like, Ryan's been in the developer tools space for years. He knows the market, he knows the companies, he knows how to build these searches. When we hire someone new who maybe doesn't have that background, there's a learning curve. It might take them a few months to really get proficient with Jewel and build out their search library.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, I try to help new people, like I'll share my searches and walk them through my approach. But ultimately, if someone's recruiting for backend engineers or mobile engineers, my searches aren't going to be that helpful. They need to build their own expertise for their domain.

**Interviewer:** What about the rest of the team? Is everyone using Jewel?

**Victoria Barnes:** Most people are, yeah. I'd say probably 75% of the team uses Jewel regularly. Ryan and a few others are power users who've really mastered it. Some people are more basic users. And we have a couple people who prefer to lean more on LinkedIn or focus on inbound candidates.

**Sophie Turner:** It also depends on the role. For some roles, inbound works pretty well. We get a lot of interest from developers who want to work on fintech infrastructure. But for more specialized roles, like Ryan's developer experience roles, you really need to do active sourcing.

**Interviewer:** What about LinkedIn? You mentioned everyone has Recruiter licenses.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, LinkedIn is essential. We're paying probably $150K a year for our LinkedIn licenses. It's a big expense, but it's necessary. Everyone uses LinkedIn to some degree.

**Ryan Mitchell:** I use LinkedIn, but honestly more for research than for actual candidate sourcing. Like, I'll use LinkedIn to look at someone's background, find mutual connections, see if I know someone who can refer them. But for actually finding candidates in the first place, I usually start in Jewel because the filtering is better and the data is fresher.

**Sophie Turner:** The integration between LinkedIn and Greenhouse is also not great. There's technically an integration, but it doesn't work smoothly. People end up manually copying data from LinkedIn to Greenhouse, which is inefficient.

**Interviewer:** What's the issue with the integration?

**Sophie Turner:** The data doesn't flow cleanly. Like, you export someone from LinkedIn and try to import them to Greenhouse, and fields don't map correctly, information gets lost, you have to manually fix things. It's just clunky. I wish it was more seamless.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, the lack of good integration between our tools is definitely a pain point. We're doing a lot of manual work to keep everything in sync.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about pain points more broadly. Beyond what you've mentioned, what are the biggest challenges you're facing?

**Ryan Mitchell:** For me, it's the specificity required for these developer experience roles. Like, the candidate pool for someone who can be a great developer advocate is not huge. They need to be technical but also creative, good at communication, comfortable with public speaking. It's a unique skill set. So I need to be really precise in my targeting. If my search is too broad, I'm overwhelmed with irrelevant candidates. If it's too narrow, I miss people. Finding that balance takes a lot of trial and error.

**Victoria Barnes:** And the market is super competitive. Every developer tools company is trying to hire the same people. Stripe, Twilio, Segment, all these companies have strong developer relations teams. So we're competing for a limited pool of talent.

**Interviewer:** How do you differentiate? What's your outreach strategy?

**Ryan Mitchell:** Personalization is critical. I'm not sending template messages. Every outreach I do is customized to that person. I might reference a blog post they wrote or a talk they gave. I'll explain specifically why I think they'd be a good fit for this role based on their background. I'll talk about what makes Plaid's developer platform interesting or challenging. It takes time to craft these messages, but it's worth it because my response rates are solid.

**Victoria Barnes:** What are your response rates?

**Ryan Mitchell:** For cold outreach, I'm usually around 25 to 30%. For warm outreach where I have some connection or referral, it's closer to 50%. So personalization and targeting definitely make a difference.

**Victoria Barnes:** That's strong performance.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, but it's because I'm being really selective. I'm not reaching out to hundreds of people. I'm identifying the 20 or 30 people who are truly a great fit, and I'm investing time in reaching out to them well.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. What other challenges are you dealing with?

**Sophie Turner:** From an operations perspective, data and reporting are always challenging. We have information spread across multiple systems - Greenhouse, Jewel, LinkedIn. Pulling it all together to create reports is time-consuming. I probably spend 30% of my time just gathering data from different places.

**Victoria Barnes:** And that's time Sophie could be spending on process improvement or other higher-value work.

**Sophie Turner:** Exactly. If we had better integration where data flowed seamlessly between systems, I could be way more efficient.

**Interviewer:** What kind of reporting do you need to do?

**Sophie Turner:** Oh, tons. *laughs* We do weekly pipeline reviews, monthly source of hire reports, time to fill tracking, diversity metrics, candidate experience surveys. And then quarterly business reviews for leadership. Our leadership team wants to see all the data.

**Victoria Barnes:** And we need to be able to show ROI on our tools. When budget season comes around, I need to justify why we're spending money on recruiting software. That requires good data.

**Sophie Turner:** Jewel actually helps with that because the analytics are built in. I can see which sources are producing candidates who make it through our funnel. But I still need to combine that with data from Greenhouse and LinkedIn to get the full picture.

**Interviewer:** What would make your life easier from a reporting standpoint?

**Sophie Turner:** Better integration, for sure. If all our tools talked to each other and I could pull everything from one dashboard, that would save me hours every week. Or if there was a way to automatically aggregate data from all our systems into one place, that would be ideal.

**Victoria Barnes:** That would be transformative.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about budget. Victoria, how do you think about the investment in recruiting tools?

**Victoria Barnes:** Tools are a significant expense. I think we're spending close to $300K a year on our recruiting tech stack. LinkedIn is the biggest piece - that's probably $150K. Then Jewel, then Greenhouse, plus some smaller tools for scheduling, assessments, background checks.

**Sophie Turner:** And the Greenhouse AI sourcing credits that we're not really using.

**Victoria Barnes:** Right. So there's always pressure to optimize. Our CFO asks regularly if we can reduce tool spend. But I always come back to the ROI question. What does it cost us if we can't hire fast enough? If we lose a great candidate to a competitor because our sourcing wasn't effective? Those costs are way higher than software licenses.

**Ryan Mitchell:** And from a productivity standpoint, good tools make a huge difference. Jewel probably makes me 40% more efficient compared to when I was just using LinkedIn at my previous company. That's like getting an extra two days of work per week.

**Victoria Barnes:** Exactly. If we can make recruiters more productive, that's worth the investment. It's cheaper than hiring more recruiters.

**Interviewer:** That's a good point. Have you looked at other sourcing tools? What else have you evaluated?

**Victoria Barnes:** We've looked at a bunch of things. Sophie probably tracks this more closely than I do.

**Sophie Turner:** Yeah, I maintain a list of sourcing tools. I think I'm tracking like 25 or 30 different options right now. The market's gotten pretty crowded.

**Interviewer:** Which ones have you seriously evaluated?

**Victoria Barnes:** We did a trial of SeekOut last year. It was interesting, especially the diversity search features, but ultimately we didn't see enough value to add another tool to our stack.

**Ryan Mitchell:** I tried HireEZ for a couple months. It was okay, but I didn't love it. The search functionality felt less precise than Jewel, and the UI was clunky. I ended up going back to what I knew.

**Victoria Barnes:** We've also looked at Gem. The CRM features look really strong, but we already have CRM capability in Jewel. And Gem is really positioned as a full recruiting platform - they want you to use it for everything. We're not interested in moving off Greenhouse.

**Sophie Turner:** Yeah, Greenhouse as our ATS works well. The issue is more on the sourcing and data integration side.

**Interviewer:** So you're committed to Greenhouse for the foreseeable future?

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, I think so. The switching costs would be really high. Our whole recruiting workflow is built around Greenhouse. Moving to a different ATS would be a huge project, and I'm not sure the benefit would be worth it. So we're looking for tools that integrate with Greenhouse, not tools that want to replace it.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Thinking about the future, what would make your sourcing more effective? What would you change if you could?

**Ryan Mitchell:** For me, better organization of saved searches would be huge. I have like 12 saved searches now, and they're just all in one big list. I wish I could organize them into folders or categories. Like, all my developer advocate searches in one place, all my solutions engineer searches in another, all my API specialist searches in a third group. That would make it much easier to navigate.

**Victoria Barnes:** That's a good point. Better organization and structure.

**Ryan Mitchell:** And it would be great if I could more easily share or duplicate searches. Like, if we hire another developer experience recruiter, I want to be able to quickly give them copies of my searches so they have a starting point. Right now, I'd have to manually walk them through rebuilding each one, which takes time.

**Sophie Turner:** From my side, better integration and data flow would be transformative. If data moved seamlessly between all our tools, I could spend way less time on data wrangling and way more time on analysis and insights.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, integration is key. Less manual work, more automation. That would make the whole team more efficient.

**Interviewer:** If you had that extra time, what would you do with it?

**Victoria Barnes:** More strategic work. More time on sourcing strategy, more time building talent pipelines, more time on employer branding and candidate experience. Less time on administrative tasks.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, if I could save even just an hour a day on system administration, that's five hours a week I could spend on outreach and relationship building. That would directly translate to more hires.

**Interviewer:** That's significant. What about new features or capabilities? Is there anything you wish existed?

**Ryan Mitchell:** I think better engagement tracking would be valuable. Like, I often reach out to people and they're interested but the timing isn't right. It would be great if the system could automatically remind me to follow up in three months or six months. Or if it could tell me when someone changes jobs, because that's often a good time to re-engage.

**Victoria Barnes:** Automated follow-up and engagement intelligence. That would be useful.

**Sophie Turner:** From a data perspective, I'd love benchmarking. Like, what's good performance for a developer advocate search? How do our metrics compare to other developer tools companies? I don't have much external context, so it's hard to know if we're doing well or if we should be doing better.

**Interviewer:** So industry benchmarking and comparative data.

**Sophie Turner:** Yeah, exactly. That would help me set better targets and identify areas where we need to improve.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about your decision-making process. How do you evaluate whether to adopt a new tool or change what you're using?

**Victoria Barnes:** It usually starts with feedback from the team. If people are telling me something isn't working or they need a capability we don't have, I take that seriously. Ryan's been a strong advocate for Jewel, and that's influenced our decisions.

**Ryan Mitchell:** I just tell it like it is. *laughs* If something works, I'm going to say so. If something doesn't work, I'm going to say that too.

**Victoria Barnes:** And that's valuable feedback. But then I also have to think about what makes sense for the whole team, not just one person. And I have to think about budget, integration with our existing tools, training requirements, all of that.

**Sophie Turner:** I usually do the initial vendor evaluations. I'll run demos, coordinate trials, collect feedback from the team, put together cost analysis. Then I make a recommendation to Victoria.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, and I'm weighing multiple factors - cost, functionality, user experience, integration capabilities, vendor reliability, scalability. It's not just about features. It's about what fits into our ecosystem and our workflow.

**Interviewer:** Are there any specific changes you're considering for the next budget cycle?

**Victoria Barnes:** We're definitely going to talk to Greenhouse about the AI sourcing credits. If we're not using them, maybe we can adjust our plan or get some kind of credit. I don't know if that's negotiable, but it's worth asking.

**Sophie Turner:** And we're thinking about expanding our Jewel license. Right now we have 10 licenses for 12 recruiters. Not everyone has access. If the people who are using it are seeing good results, maybe we should roll it out to everyone.

**Ryan Mitchell:** I think that would be great. If everyone had the same tools I have, the whole team would be more productive.

**Victoria Barnes:** But we'd need to invest in training. We can't just give people a license and expect them to figure it out. We'd need structured onboarding, best practices documentation, ongoing support.

**Sophie Turner:** I could build that out. Training materials, video tutorials, office hours where people can ask questions.

**Victoria Barnes:** Yeah, let's explore that. If we're going to expand access, we should do it properly.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Is there anything else you think I should know about your sourcing challenges or needs?

**Ryan Mitchell:** I think the main thing for me is just the complexity and specialization of the roles. Developer experience is a unique discipline. Developer advocates, solutions engineers, API specialists - these aren't generic engineering roles. They require specific skills and backgrounds. Having tools that can handle that nuance and let me target precisely is really important. Generic sourcing tools don't cut it for what I do.

**Victoria Barnes:** And as we continue to grow, we need scalable solutions. We're hiring 35 to 40 people per quarter now, but that could easily go up. We need tools and processes that can scale with us.

**Sophie Turner:** Yeah, and from an ops perspective, as the team grows, everything gets more complex. More data, more workflows, more coordination. We need systems that can handle increased volume without breaking.

**Interviewer:** Those are all great points. Well, I really appreciate you all taking the time. This has been super insightful.

**Victoria Barnes:** Of course. Thanks for taking the time to understand our needs. These kinds of conversations are always useful for us too.

**Ryan Mitchell:** Yeah, and if you build solutions to any of these problems, definitely let us know.

**Sophie Turner:** We'd be happy to beta test. *laughs*

**Interviewer:** *laughs* Noted. Thanks again, everyone.
