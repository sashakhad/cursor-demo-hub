## Opening

**Interviewer**: Thank you all for making the time today. I know schedules at Bridgewater are very full, so I appreciate you prioritizing this conversation. Shall we start with introductions?

**Michael Thompson (Managing Director - Talent Acquisition)**: Certainly. I'm Michael Thompson, Managing Director of Talent Acquisition here at Bridgewater. I've been with the firm for approximately eleven years, and I oversee all of our global recruiting efforts. We have a talent acquisition team of about 45 people across our Westport headquarters and our international offices.

**Jennifer Rodriguez (VP of Technology Recruiting)**: Jennifer Rodriguez, VP of Technology Recruiting. I've been at Bridgewater for seven years, and I focus specifically on our technology hiring - software engineers, data engineers, infrastructure roles, that sort of thing. My team is about 15 recruiters.

**Robert Park (Director of Investment Research Recruiting)**: Robert Park, I direct investment research recruiting. I've been here for nine years. My team recruits for our investment researchers, portfolio strategists, quantitative analysts - the folks who are building and implementing our investment strategies. We're about 10 recruiters.

**Interviewer**: Excellent. Can you give me a sense of the scale of hiring at Bridgewater?

**Michael Thompson**: We're selective but we do hire at meaningful scale. Firm-wide, we're bringing on approximately 300 to 400 people per year. That includes investment professionals, technologists, operations, client service - the full spectrum. Of that, probably 40% are technology roles, 30% are investment-related, and 30% are other functions.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: On the technology side, we're filling 120 to 150 roles per year. That's a mix of software engineers, data engineers, infrastructure engineers, security roles. We've been growing our technology organization pretty significantly over the past five years.

**Robert Park**: Investment research is smaller in volume but very high touch. We're maybe filling 30 to 40 roles per year, but each one is critical and the evaluation process is quite rigorous.

**Interviewer**: And what does your current recruiting tech stack look like?

**Michael Thompson**: We use Workday as our core ATS. We implemented it about four years ago as part of a broader HR systems overhaul. It's enterprise-grade, it meets our security and compliance requirements, and it integrates with our other HR systems. For sourcing, we primarily rely on LinkedIn Recruiter - every recruiter on the team has a license. We also work with executive search firms for senior roles, particularly at the Managing Director level and above.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: We've also experimented with a few other tools over the years. Some internal tools that our engineering team built for specific use cases, though those haven't been as successful as we'd hoped. And we've piloted a few external sourcing platforms, but nothing has stuck.

**Interviewer**: What's driving you to evaluate new sourcing solutions now?

**Michael Thompson**: A few things. One, we're seeing increasing competition for specialized talent - both on the investment side and the technology side. Two, we want to be more data-driven in our recruiting approach. And three, we recognize that LinkedIn alone isn't sufficient for the complexity of what we're trying to do. We need more sophisticated filtering and search capabilities.

## Current State Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's dig into how recruiting works today. Jennifer, maybe you could walk me through a typical technology hire?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Sure. So let's say we have a req for a data engineer. First step is intake with the hiring manager - understanding what they actually need. Data engineer is a broad title, and at Bridgewater it could mean several different things.

Are we talking about someone who's building data pipelines to ingest and process alternative data? Someone who's building the infrastructure for our portfolio analytics? Someone who's working on our risk management systems? These are quite different roles with different technical requirements.

**Robert Park**: Same challenge on the investment side. "Quantitative researcher" could mean a lot of different things.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Exactly. So once I understand what we actually need, I start sourcing. I open up LinkedIn Recruiter, and I start building a search. I'll filter by title - "data engineer" or related titles. Then I'll add skills - SQL, Python, Spark, Airflow, whatever's relevant for this particular role. Then I'll think about company background - where have we successfully hired data engineers from in the past? Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon - companies with mature data infrastructure.

**Interviewer**: How long does it take you to build a search like that?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Honestly, probably 30 to 45 minutes to build a good search. And then I need to review the results, refine the criteria, test different keyword combinations. So call it an hour or two to get to a solid candidate pool.

**Michael Thompson**: And that's repeated for every req. We don't have good ways to save and reuse searches across similar roles.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Right. I mean, LinkedIn lets you save searches, but they're pretty basic. If I want to build a complex Boolean search with multiple criteria, I'm essentially rebuilding it each time or copying from a document.

**Interviewer**: Do you maintain documentation of your search strategies?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: I have a Word document with my best search strings for different role types. Other recruiters have their own systems. It's not standardized across the team.

**Michael Thompson**: Which is a problem from a knowledge management perspective. Jennifer's been doing this for seven years - she knows what works. But if she were to leave tomorrow, we'd lose a lot of that institutional knowledge.

**Robert Park**: I have the same issue on the investment research side. I've developed search strategies over nine years that work well for finding quantitative researchers with the right backgrounds, but it's all in my head or in my personal notes.

**Interviewer**: Robert, can you walk me through your sourcing process for an investment research role?

**Robert Park**: Yes, so investment research roles are particularly nuanced. We're looking for people with very specific combinations of skills and experiences. Let me give you an example - we recently hired a quantitative researcher focused on macroeconomic strategy.

For that role, we needed someone with a PhD in economics, strong quantitative skills - econometrics, time series analysis, that sort of thing - and deep understanding of global macroeconomic dynamics. Ideally, they'd have experience at a central bank, another hedge fund, or maybe an economic consulting firm.

**Interviewer**: That's quite specific.

**Robert Park**: Very specific. So my LinkedIn search is filtering for PhD in economics, looking for keywords like "econometrics," "macroeconomics," "monetary policy," "fiscal policy," "central banking." I'm looking at people who've worked at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the IMF, the World Bank. I'm looking at other hedge funds like Millennium, Bridgewater competitors.

But here's the challenge - that search is completely different from if I'm recruiting for a quantitative researcher focused on systematic equity strategies. That person needs a very different background.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Same issue in technology. If I'm recruiting a data engineer focused on alternative data, that's different from a data engineer focused on portfolio analytics, which is different from a data engineer focused on risk management.

**Interviewer**: How many distinct personas do you think you're recruiting for across technology and investment research?

**Michael Thompson**: That's a great question. I'd say in technology alone, we probably have 15 to 20 distinct personas. And in investment research, probably another 10 to 15.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: And each one requires a different sourcing strategy.

**Interviewer**: What's working well with your current setup? What are you happy with?

**Michael Thompson**: Workday is stable and secure, which is important for us. It handles our compliance requirements, our audit needs, our data governance policies. Those aren't exciting features, but they're table stakes given our regulatory environment.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: LinkedIn has broad reach. For more general technology roles, it's fine. We get reasonable response rates, and the data is generally accurate.

**Robert Park**: Our executive search partners are excellent for senior roles. They understand our culture, they have deep networks, they handle the delicate outreach required for confidential searches. For Managing Director-level roles and above, we're very comfortable with that model.

**Interviewer**: And what about candidate relationship management? How do you stay in touch with people who aren't ready to move now but might be good fits in the future?

**Michael Thompson**: That's an area where we're not as strong as we should be. We don't have a systematic CRM. Recruiters manage relationships individually - usually through email, sometimes through LinkedIn. But there's no coordinated approach.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: I keep a spreadsheet of interesting candidates I've talked to over the years. People who were great but we didn't have the right role at the time, or who weren't ready to move. I'll periodically reach back out, but it's manual.

**Robert Park**: Same here. Investment research recruiting is very relationship-driven. I might talk to someone who's at the Fed and happy there, but I want to stay on their radar for when they're ready to move to the private sector. Right now, I'm doing that through personal outreach and calendar reminders.

## Pain Points Exploration

**Interviewer**: Let's dig deeper into the challenges. Robert, you mentioned the complexity of different investment research personas. Can you walk me through all the variations you're managing?

**Robert Park**: Absolutely. So within investment research, I'd say there are at least four major personas, each with very different requirements.

First, you have quantitative researchers with an economics background. These are people with PhDs in economics, often from top programs - Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, Chicago. They might have worked at central banks, international financial institutions, economic consulting firms, or academia. They need deep understanding of macroeconomic theory, econometric methods, policy analysis.

**Michael Thompson**: And the search criteria for these folks is very education-focused. Top-tier PhD programs, publications in economics journals, work experience at prestigious institutions.

**Robert Park**: Exactly. So when I'm building a search for this persona, I'm filtering by PhD in economics, looking at specific universities, searching for keywords like "econometrics," "monetary policy," "fiscal policy," "macroeconomic modeling." I'm looking at employment history at the Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, or top economics departments.

Then the second major persona is platform engineers with financial systems experience. These are the technologists who build and maintain our investment technology infrastructure - our portfolio management systems, our risk management platforms, our trading systems. They need strong software engineering skills - usually Java, Python, C++ - and deep understanding of financial markets and investment processes.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: These folks are often coming from other asset managers, hedge funds, investment banks, or financial technology companies.

**Robert Park**: Right. So the search completely changes. Now I'm looking for software engineering backgrounds, but with keywords like "portfolio management," "order management system," "risk management," "trading systems," "financial markets." I'm looking at companies like BlackRock, Two Sigma, AQR, or investment banks' technology divisions.

**Interviewer**: So very different from the economics researchers.

**Robert Park**: Completely different. The third persona is data engineers with alternative data expertise. Alternative data has become huge in investment management - satellite imagery, credit card transaction data, web scraping, geolocation data. We need engineers who can source, process, and analyze these non-traditional datasets.

**Michael Thompson**: This is a relatively newer persona for us. Five years ago, we weren't really recruiting for this profile. Now it's critical.

**Robert Park**: These folks need strong data engineering skills - Python, Spark, big data technologies - but also creativity and domain knowledge about alternative data sources. They're often coming from tech companies that work with large-scale consumer data, or from data vendors, or from other hedge funds that are sophisticated with alternative data.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: So the search shifts to data engineering keywords plus alternative data keywords - "satellite imagery," "geolocation data," "web scraping," "credit card data," "consumer transaction data."

**Robert Park**: Exactly. And companies change too - now I'm looking at Orbital Insight, SafeGraph, Second Measure, or data divisions at tech companies like Google or Uber.

The fourth major persona is machine learning engineers with portfolio optimization experience. These folks are using machine learning techniques - neural networks, reinforcement learning, ensemble methods - to improve our investment strategies. They need both strong ML engineering skills and understanding of portfolio management.

**Interviewer**: And where do these people come from?

**Robert Park**: It's a mix. Sometimes they're coming from other quantitative hedge funds - Renaissance, Two Sigma, Millennium. Sometimes from tech companies with strong ML teams - DeepMind, Google Brain, Facebook AI Research. Sometimes from academia - PhD students or postdocs who've been doing research in machine learning applications to finance.

**Michael Thompson**: The educational background is usually a PhD in computer science, statistics, or mathematics, with focus on machine learning.

**Robert Park**: Right. So the search criteria shifts again - PhD in CS or related field, publications in machine learning conferences, keywords like "deep learning," "reinforcement learning," "neural networks," "portfolio optimization," "quantitative finance."

**Interviewer**: So four completely different searches for roles that all fall under "investment research"?

**Robert Park**: At minimum. And these are the major categories - there are sub-variations within each. For example, within quantitative researchers with economics backgrounds, someone focused on macro is different from someone focused on microeconomic data or labor economics.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: We have the same challenge in technology. Let me walk through data engineering specifically, since we mentioned it.

Within data engineers, we have at least three distinct personas. First, data infrastructure engineers who are building the platforms and pipelines. These folks are deep in distributed systems, big data technologies - Spark, Kafka, Airflow - database systems, data warehousing. They're often coming from tech companies with massive scale data challenges - Google, Facebook, Netflix, Uber.

**Michael Thompson**: The search for these folks is very infrastructure-focused.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Right - "distributed systems," "data pipeline," "Apache Spark," "Kafka," "data warehouse," "ETL." Looking at companies known for data infrastructure excellence.

Second persona is analytics engineers who are closer to the business. They're building data models, designing analytics, creating dashboards and reports that our investment professionals use. They need SQL expertise, data modeling skills, understanding of BI tools, and important - they need to understand investment management and financial markets.

**Robert Park**: These folks need to speak both technology and business language.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Exactly. So the search shifts - still data engineering backgrounds, but now I'm looking for "analytics," "business intelligence," "data modeling," "SQL," "Tableau," "Looker." And I'm looking at financial services companies more - other asset managers, banks, fintech companies.

The third persona is machine learning platform engineers. These are the folks building the infrastructure that supports our ML research - model training pipelines, feature stores, model deployment systems, ML monitoring. They need both infrastructure engineering skills and understanding of machine learning workflows.

**Interviewer**: And they're coming from different companies?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Often from tech companies with mature ML platforms - Google, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb. Or from AI-first companies. The keywords shift to "ML infrastructure," "model deployment," "feature store," "ML ops," "TensorFlow," "PyTorch."

**Michael Thompson**: So you can see the pattern - every major role type has multiple personas within it, and each persona requires a distinct sourcing strategy.

**Interviewer**: How are you managing all of these variations today?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Not very well, honestly. I have my document with search strings. Robert has his. Each recruiter has their own system. There's no standardization, no easy way to share best practices, no version control on what's working.

**Robert Park**: And when I go on vacation, whoever covers my roles has to figure out how I would search. They don't have access to my nine years of learning about what works.

**Michael Thompson**: This is one of the core problems we're trying to solve. How do we capture this institutional knowledge? How do we make it accessible to the whole team? How do we build consistency across recruiters?

**Interviewer**: What other pain points are you experiencing?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Contact data quality is inconsistent. LinkedIn email deliverability is probably 75 to 80%, which means one in four or five emails bounces. For specialized roles where there might only be 50 qualified candidates in the market, every bounce hurts.

**Robert Park**: Data staleness is another issue. Someone's LinkedIn profile says they're at the IMF, but they moved to Bridgewater's competitor six months ago. So we're wasting time on outdated information.

**Michael Thompson**: We also lack good analytics. I can pull basic metrics from Workday - time-to-fill, source of hire, that sort of thing. But I can't easily answer questions like: Which sourcing strategies are most effective for data engineers? How does candidate quality vary by source? What messaging gets the best response rates? The data exists but it's not actionable.

**Interviewer**: What about budget constraints? How do you think about cost?

**Michael Thompson**: We're fortunate that recruiting is viewed as strategic and we have reasonable budget. We're spending probably $150,000 annually on LinkedIn Recruiter for the team, plus significant spend on executive search. We're not in a cost-cutting mode, but we do need to justify investments with clear ROI.

## Competitive Landscape

**Interviewer**: What other sourcing tools have you evaluated or considered?

**Michael Thompson**: We've looked at several over the years. Obviously LinkedIn is our current baseline. We've also had demos with several vendors - Gem, Hired, SeekOut, others I'm probably forgetting.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: We tried Gem about two years ago. It's focused on outbound engagement - email sequences, analytics on messaging effectiveness. Which is valuable, but it didn't solve our core problem, which is finding the right candidates in the first place. If I don't have the right target list, better email sequencing doesn't help.

**Robert Park**: We looked at SeekOut as well. It has some interesting features around diversity sourcing and contact data. But we weren't convinced it had the depth of profiles for our specialized needs.

**Michael Thompson**: We also explored building internal tools. Our engineering team built a candidate sourcing tool a few years ago that was supposed to help with specialized searches. But it never got the investment it needed, the user interface was clunky, and adoption was low.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: The reality is that building recruiting tools isn't our core competency. We should be buying best-in-class solutions, not trying to build them ourselves.

**Interviewer**: What about other hedge funds or asset managers? What are they using?

**Michael Thompson**: We talk to peers in the industry, but everyone has different approaches. I know Two Sigma uses Jewel for some of their recruiting. Point72 has a different setup. It really depends on the firm's size, culture, and specific needs.

**Robert Park**: From what I hear, most quantitative hedge funds are struggling with similar challenges - how to source for highly specialized roles, how to manage multiple personas, how to build institutional knowledge.

**Interviewer**: What would make you consider switching away from your current setup?

**Michael Thompson**: We'd need to see significant improvement in one or more of these areas: Better filtering and search capabilities that handle our complexity. Better candidate relationship management. Better analytics and insights. Better data quality. And it would need to integrate with Workday without creating data silos.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: For me, it's really about the filtering sophistication. If a tool can handle the persona complexity we've been discussing - if I can build, save, and reuse complex searches for all my different data engineering personas - that would be transformative.

**Robert Park**: Same for investment research. If I could have a library of optimized searches for all the different quantitative researcher profiles, and share those with my team, and refine them over time, that would save enormous time and improve consistency.

**Interviewer**: What does your vendor evaluation process look like?

**Michael Thompson**: It's rigorous, as you might expect. It starts with a business case - what problem are we solving, what's the expected ROI, what are the alternatives. That goes through talent acquisition leadership, finance, and potentially executive team depending on the investment size.

If approved, we move into detailed vendor evaluation. That includes security review - we need SOC 2 Type II compliance at minimum, understanding of data residency and encryption, penetration testing results. Legal review - contract terms, liability provisions, data ownership. Technical review - how does it integrate with Workday, what's the API like, what's the data model.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: We'd also want to do a pilot. We're not going to roll out a new tool to 45 recruiters globally on day one. We'd start with a small team - maybe my technology recruiting team - run it for three to six months, measure the impact, gather feedback.

**Michael Thompson**: The whole process, from initial business case to full rollout, is probably nine to twelve months. That's just the reality of operating at our scale with our security and compliance requirements.

**Interviewer**: That's a significant timeline. What's the budget environment for new tools right now?

**Michael Thompson**: As I mentioned, we're fortunate that talent acquisition is viewed as strategic. If we can build a solid business case with clear ROI, we can get budget approved. We'd probably be comfortable investing $100,000 to $200,000 annually for a tool that genuinely improves our effectiveness.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: The ROI calculation is about time savings, quality improvement, and speed. If we can reduce time-to-fill by 20%, that's real value. If we can improve candidate quality such that we have higher offer acceptance rates and better retention, that's valuable. If we can make each recruiter 30% more efficient, maybe we don't need to grow the team as fast.

**Robert Park**: And there's the knowledge management value. If we can capture and share best practices across the team, that has long-term strategic value beyond immediate efficiency gains.

## Future Needs & Closing

**Interviewer**: As you think about the ideal sourcing solution for Bridgewater, what would that look like?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: For me, it's sophistication in filtering and reusability of searches. I want to build these complex, multi-dimensional search strategies for every persona I recruit for - save them, refine them over time, share them with colleagues. I want someone new to the team to be able to leverage years of institutional knowledge from day one.

**Robert Park**: I'd add relationship management. A proper CRM where I can track all interactions with candidates over time, set reminders for follow-up, segment my pipeline, see the complete history. That would be really valuable for the long-term relationship building we do.

**Michael Thompson**: Analytics and insights are critical for me. I want to know what's working and what's not. Which sourcing strategies yield the best candidates? Which companies are the best sources of talent? How do different outreach approaches perform? I want data-driven decision making.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: And integration is key. It needs to work seamlessly with Workday. We can't have recruiters maintaining candidate information in multiple systems or manually copying data between tools.

**Interviewer**: What about data quality?

**Robert Park**: Fresh, accurate contact data is important. If a tool claims to have comprehensive coverage but the email bounce rate is 30%, that's not acceptable. We need confidence that when we're reaching out to someone, we're actually reaching them.

**Interviewer**: If you were to move forward with evaluating Jewel more seriously, what would the next steps look like?

**Michael Thompson**: We'd want a detailed product demonstration focused on our specific use cases. Can it handle the filtering complexity we've discussed? How does the CRM work? What do the analytics look like? How does the Workday integration function?

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: I'd want to see specific examples of how other hedge funds or asset managers are using it. Case studies, references we could talk to. People who are recruiting for similar specialized roles.

**Robert Park**: I'd want to understand the learning curve. How long does it take to get up to speed? What does training look like? What kind of ongoing support is provided?

**Michael Thompson**: And we'd need to start the vendor evaluation process in parallel. Security documentation, compliance certifications, technical architecture, contract terms. That can happen concurrently with the product evaluation.

**Interviewer**: What's your timeline for making a decision on new sourcing tools?

**Michael Thompson**: We're currently in exploration mode. I'd say we're probably four to six months from a formal decision. We want to see multiple options, talk to peers about their experiences, build a comprehensive business case.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: And we need to set baseline metrics now so we can measure improvement. What's our current time-to-fill? What's our current candidate quality? What's our sourcing efficiency? We need those benchmarks.

**Interviewer**: This has been extremely valuable. I really appreciate you taking the time and being so open about your challenges and needs. Is there anything else I should understand about your recruiting environment?

**Robert Park**: I'd just emphasize that Bridgewater has a unique culture. We value radical transparency, thoughtful disagreement, idea meritocracy. The candidates we're looking for aren't just technically excellent - they need to be people who will thrive in our culture. That's harder to assess through sourcing tools, but it's critical.

**Michael Thompson**: That's an important point. The tool gets us to the right candidates from a skills and experience perspective. But then we have a rigorous assessment process to evaluate culture fit, intellectual curiosity, openness to feedback, all the things that matter here.

**Interviewer**: Absolutely. Well, thank you all again. I'll follow up with more detailed materials - product documentation, case studies, reference contacts. And we can set up a comprehensive product demonstration as a next step if that makes sense.

**Michael Thompson**: That would be valuable. Thanks for your time, Sarah.

**Jennifer Rodriguez**: Thanks.

**Robert Park**: Appreciate it.
