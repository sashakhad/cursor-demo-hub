**Interviewer:** Thanks so much for taking the time today, Emily and Tom. I really appreciate you both being here. So, just to set the stage, we're doing these customer discovery conversations to better understand how companies like yours are approaching sourcing and what's working, what's not working in the current landscape. There's no sales pitch here—we genuinely just want to learn from you all. Sound good?

**Emily Martinez:** Yeah, absolutely. Happy to share. We've been, you know, pretty actively evaluating our sourcing stack lately, so the timing is actually perfect.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, same. I'm excited to talk through this stuff.

**Interviewer:** Awesome. So maybe we can start with some context. Emily, can you give me a quick overview of Notion's recruiting operation? Like, team size, hiring volume, that sort of thing?

**Emily Martinez:** Sure. So, we're a team of about twelve full-time recruiters right now, plus a couple of coordinators and sourcers. We're definitely still in growth mode—I mean, we're not at the crazy 2021 pace anymore, thank god, but we're still hiring pretty actively. I'd say we're closing maybe twenty to twenty-five roles per quarter right now, which is down from, like, forty or fifty back in the boom times. But it's still a lot, you know?

**Tom Bradley:** And just to add to that, from my side, I focus specifically on product design roles. That's probably four to six roles per quarter for me personally. We've been building out both our core product design team and our brand design team, so there's a lot of variety in the types of designers we're looking for.

**Interviewer:** Got it. And what's your current tech stack look like? What are you using for ATS, sourcing, all that?

**Emily Martinez:** So we're on Greenhouse for our ATS. We switched over from Lever maybe two years ago? Tom, was it two years?

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, almost exactly two years. It was right before I joined, actually.

**Emily Martinez:** Right, right. So Greenhouse is our ATS. And then for sourcing, we're using a combination of things. LinkedIn Recruiter, obviously—everyone uses that. We were using Greenhouse's AI sourcing module for a bit, which came bundled with our contract. And then we also have Juicebox, which Tom actually pushed for pretty hard.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, I mean, I'd used Juicebox at my last company, and I was like, we need this. The saved filters alone are worth it.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. We'll definitely dig into that. So you mentioned Greenhouse AI sourcing—are you still using that?

**Emily Martinez:** Um, we're sort of in this transitional phase. We have access to it because it's bundled into our Greenhouse contract, but honestly, not everyone on the team is using it actively. Some people love it, some people find it frustrating. It's been a mixed bag.

**Tom Bradley:** I basically stopped using it, like, six months ago. I tried it for a few months when we first got access, but it just... I don't know, it didn't stick for me. The interface felt clunky, and I felt like I was spending more time trying to understand what the AI was doing than actually sourcing.

**Interviewer:** That's really helpful context. Okay, so let's dig in a bit. I want to understand your current workflow. Tom, since you mentioned you use Juicebox pretty heavily, can you walk me through how you're sourcing for a typical product design role?

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, sure. So, okay, let me think of a recent example. We just filled a Senior Product Designer role for our enterprise team. That was a really interesting search because we needed someone who could think at a systems level—like, really understand design systems, component libraries, all that—but also be comfortable working with our sales team and customers directly. It's a pretty specific combo.

**Interviewer:** Mmhmm.

**Tom Bradley:** So my process usually starts with me spending some time, you know, really understanding the role with the hiring manager. What are we actually looking for? What are the must-haves versus nice-to-haves? For this role, the must-haves were: experience with complex B2B products, strong design systems background, and Figma expertise—like, really strong Figma expertise, not just "I can use Figma."

**Interviewer:** Right.

**Tom Bradley:** And then once I have that clarity, I go into Juicebox and I start building out my filters. This is where it gets interesting, because product design is not a monolith, right? The filters I use for this enterprise systems designer role are totally different from the filters I'd use for, like, a consumer-facing product designer or a brand designer.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about that. What do you mean by different filter sets?

**Tom Bradley:** Okay, so for that enterprise systems designer role, I'm filtering for people who have worked at companies with really strong design systems practices. So I'm looking at companies like Airbnb, Stripe, Figma itself, Atlassian—places that are known for their systems thinking. I'm also filtering for people whose titles include words like "systems," "platform," "design systems," or "component library." And then I'm looking for people who've been in their roles for at least two years, because systems work takes time to mature.

**Emily Martinez:** Tom's gotten really sophisticated with this.

**Tom Bradley:** Well, I've had to, because here's the thing: if I just search for "product designer," I get thousands of results, and maybe ten percent are actually relevant. So I've basically built out these personas in Juicebox. I have a saved filter set for "systems-oriented designers," another one for "visual/brand-forward designers," another one for "design-to-engineering hybrids"—that's for designers who can code—and then another one for "growth/experimentation designers."

**Interviewer:** Wait, so you have multiple saved filter sets that you're just switching between depending on the role?

**Tom Bradley:** Exactly. And that's been a game-changer for me, because I'm not reinventing the wheel every time. Like, last quarter I had two enterprise design roles and one consumer role, and I could just pull up the appropriate saved filter set and start sourcing immediately. It probably saves me, I don't know, three or four hours per role just in setup time.

**Interviewer:** That's fascinating. How many of these personas do you have?

**Tom Bradley:** Um, I have five saved filter sets right now. Let me think... There's the systems-oriented one I mentioned, the visual/brand-forward one, design-to-engineering hybrids, growth designers, and then I have one for accessibility specialists, which is a newer one I built out because we've been hiring more in that area.

**Emily Martinez:** And this is actually something we've been thinking about scaling across the team. Tom's been kind of our pioneer on this, but we're wondering if this approach could work for our engineering recruiters, our PM recruiters, everyone.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. So Emily, when you look at Tom's approach, what are you seeing that makes you want to scale it?

**Emily Martinez:** I mean, the efficiency gains are obvious. But more than that, it's the quality of candidates. Tom's hit rate on replies and interest is significantly higher than some of our other recruiters, and I think a big part of that is because he's being so targeted. He's not just blasting out to anyone with "product designer" in their title. He's thinking about the actual persona of the candidate and matching it to the role.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, and candidates notice that. I've had people reply and say, like, "Wow, this actually seems like a role that's relevant to my background," which sounds basic, but you'd be surprised how much generic outreach is out there.

**Interviewer:** Absolutely. Okay, so let's talk about the tools you're using to execute this strategy. You mentioned Juicebox for the saved filters. Are you using the free version or the paid version?

**Tom Bradley:** We have the paid version. I think we upgraded maybe six months ago? Emily, was it six months?

**Emily Martinez:** Yeah, around there. We were on the free version for a while, and it was actually pretty good—like, the core filtering and saved filters were available even on the free tier. But we hit the limit on searches per month, and we also wanted access to some of the more advanced features, like the Chrome extension and the bulk export functionality.

**Tom Bradley:** The Chrome extension is clutch, by the way. I can be looking at someone's LinkedIn profile and just click the extension, and it pulls up their Juicebox profile with all the updated contact info. It's so much faster than tab-switching.

**Interviewer:** Nice. And how's the contact data quality been?

**Tom Bradley:** Um, mostly good? I'd say the accuracy is probably like seventy-five to eighty percent, which is pretty standard from what I understand. The issue we've run into is staleness.

**Interviewer:** Staleness?

**Emily Martinez:** Yeah, so Juicebox updates their contact database quarterly, which sounds fine on paper, but in practice, especially in the tech world, people move around a lot. So we've definitely had situations where we're reaching out to an email address that's no longer valid because the person changed companies two months ago.

**Tom Bradley:** It's not a Juicebox-specific problem, though. We've had the same issue with ZoomInfo and basically every other contact data provider. I think the fundamental challenge is just that contact data goes stale quickly.

**Interviewer:** Right, that makes sense. So let's talk about Greenhouse AI sourcing for a minute. You mentioned you tried it but moved away from it. What was the experience like?

**Tom Bradley:** So, I tried to give it a fair shot. I used it actively for probably three or four months. The promise was that it would use AI to help me find better candidates faster, right? And the intake form was actually pretty nice—it asked questions about the role, the requirements, all that. But then the results it gave me were just... not great.

**Interviewer:** Not great in what way?

**Tom Bradley:** They felt really generic. Like, it was giving me results that were technically in the right ballpark—they were product designers—but they didn't have the nuance I needed. For example, for that enterprise systems role I mentioned earlier, Greenhouse AI was giving me a lot of consumer product designers from random startups. They had "product designer" in their title, sure, but they weren't systems thinkers. They didn't have the experience I was looking for.

**Emily Martinez:** And the other issue was the UX. The interface was just confusing. It felt like it was bolted onto Greenhouse rather than being natively integrated.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, exactly. I remember there were all these tabs and sections, and I could never remember where things were. It just added friction to my workflow instead of removing it. With Juicebox, I feel like I'm in control. I can see exactly what filters I'm applying, I can tweak them, I can save them. With Greenhouse AI, it felt like a black box. The AI was doing something, but I didn't really understand what, and I couldn't easily adjust it.

**Interviewer:** That's really valuable feedback. So it sounds like transparency and control are important to you.

**Tom Bradley:** A hundred percent. I mean, I'm not anti-AI at all. I think AI can be really powerful for sourcing. But I need to understand what it's doing and be able to guide it. I can't just trust it blindly.

**Emily Martinez:** And I think that's a generational thing too, right? Tom's been recruiting for, what, eight years? He knows what good looks like. He's not going to just take the AI's word for it.

**Interviewer:** Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, let's talk about pain points more broadly. If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your sourcing process, what would it be?

**Emily Martinez:** Oh, that's easy. Data staleness. Hands down.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, I'd agree with that. It's such a tax on our time. I'll build this beautiful filter set, get a list of a hundred great candidates, and then I start reaching out, and twenty percent of the emails bounce. It's so frustrating.

**Emily Martinez:** And it's not just the bounced emails. It's also people who've changed roles but the database hasn't updated. So I'm reaching out to someone saying, "I saw you're a product designer at Airbnb," and they reply, "Actually, I left Airbnb three months ago and I'm now at Apple." It just makes us look out of touch.

**Interviewer:** Right, that's not a great candidate experience.

**Emily Martinez:** No, it's not. And in a market where candidates have options, we can't afford to look sloppy.

**Tom Bradley:** The other big pain point for me is just the sheer number of tools we're using. I've got LinkedIn Recruiter open, Juicebox open, Greenhouse open, sometimes I'm also in GEM for sequencing. It's a lot of tab-switching, a lot of copying and pasting. I'd love if there was more integration between these tools.

**Interviewer:** Have you looked at any tools that promise that kind of integration?

**Tom Bradley:** We've looked at a few. I think we demoed GEM and Sourcing.io at one point. Emily, did we demo anything else?

**Emily Martinez:** We looked at Beamery, but that was more for CRM functionality than sourcing. And honestly, a lot of these tools are just too expensive right now. We're trying to be really thoughtful about budget.

**Interviewer:** Yeah, I want to talk about budget in a minute. But first, let's dive a bit deeper into the saved filter thing, because I'm really intrigued by this. Tom, you mentioned you have five personas for product design. Can you walk me through another one just so I can understand the nuance?

**Tom Bradley:** Sure. So let's take the "visual/brand-forward designer" persona. This is for roles where we need someone who's not just functionally strong, but has a really refined visual design sense. Someone who thinks about aesthetics, motion, brand consistency—all that.

**Interviewer:** Okay.

**Tom Bradley:** So for this persona, I'm filtering for designers who've worked at companies with really strong brand identities. I'm talking like Apple, Stripe, Notion obviously, Cash App, Retool—companies where the brand is part of the product. I'm also looking for designers whose titles include words like "visual," "brand," or "creative." And I'm looking at their portfolios to see if they have motion design work, illustration work, that kind of thing.

**Interviewer:** And that's a saved filter in Juicebox?

**Tom Bradley:** Yep. I've got it saved as "Visual/Brand Designers - Premium." And I can just pull it up whenever I have a role that fits that profile.

**Interviewer:** And how different are the results between that persona and, say, the systems-oriented persona?

**Tom Bradley:** Totally different. There's probably like ten to fifteen percent overlap, but the vast majority of candidates are different. The visual/brand designers are often people who've worked in smaller design teams where they wear multiple hats. The systems designers are usually from larger companies with more specialized roles. It's a different vibe, different backgrounds.

**Emily Martinez:** And this is exactly why we want to scale this approach. We're starting to realize that these nuanced personas exist for every role family, not just product design. Like, our engineering team is hiring for backend engineers, but there's a huge difference between a backend engineer who works on infrastructure versus one who works on payments versus one who works on data pipelines. They're all "backend engineers," but they're not interchangeable.

**Interviewer:** That's a really interesting insight. So you're seeing this persona problem across multiple role families?

**Emily Martinez:** Absolutely. Product managers are the same way. We have PM roles for consumer product, PM roles for enterprise product, PM roles for platform/API product. They require totally different backgrounds and skills.

**Interviewer:** Got it. Okay, so let's talk about the competitive landscape for a minute. You mentioned you've demoed GEM, Sourcing.io, Beamery. What else is on your radar?

**Emily Martinez:** We've looked at HireEZ—that's the new name for Hiretual, I think? We've also had some conversations with SeekOut. And we're generally keeping an eye on what Greenhouse is doing with their AI stuff, since we're already paying for it.

**Tom Bradley:** I've also played around with some of the newer AI tools, like Juicebox AI and some others. But a lot of them are still in beta or don't have the feature depth I need yet.

**Interviewer:** What do you like and dislike about the tools you've demoed?

**Emily Martinez:** GEM is interesting. They have really good sequencing and automation features, which would be great for our top-of-funnel outreach. But the filtering and search capabilities feel less robust than Juicebox. It's like they're optimized for different parts of the funnel.

**Tom Bradley:** SeekOut has a huge database, which is appealing. But the UI is kind of overwhelming. There's so much going on, so many options and toggles. I feel like I'd need to do a whole training course just to use it effectively.

**Emily Martinez:** And then there's the cost factor. A lot of these tools are quite expensive, especially at our size. We're not Google or Meta with unlimited budgets. We need to be strategic about what we're spending on.

**Interviewer:** What does your budget situation look like right now?

**Emily Martinez:** I mean, we have budget for recruiting tools, but we're being more conservative than we were a couple years ago. The whole market has shifted, right? We're not in hypergrowth mode anymore. We need to show ROI for everything we're spending on.

**Tom Bradley:** Which is why I've been so focused on efficiency. If I can use Juicebox's saved filters to cut my sourcing time in half, that's a huge ROI right there. I don't need a fancy AI tool that costs three times as much and doesn't actually make me faster.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. So when you're evaluating new tools, what are the key criteria you're looking at?

**Emily Martinez:** ROI is number one. Like Tom said, we need to see that it's actually making us faster or more effective. Number two is ease of use. We don't have time for tools with steep learning curves. Number three is integration with our existing stack, especially Greenhouse. And number four is cost—it needs to be reasonable for a company our size.

**Tom Bradley:** I'd also add that the data quality matters a lot to me. If the contact data is stale or inaccurate, it doesn't matter how good the filtering is.

**Interviewer:** Right. So on that data quality point, what would "good" look like to you? Like, if you could design the ideal solution, what would it be?

**Tom Bradley:** Honestly, I'd love real-time data. I know that's probably unrealistic, but even if the data was updated monthly instead of quarterly, that would be a huge improvement. And I'd love more transparency about when data was last updated. Like, if I'm looking at a candidate profile, show me a timestamp that says "last updated on X date."

**Emily Martinez:** I'd also love better validation. Like, if you're giving me an email address, tell me the confidence level. Is this email ninety-five percent likely to be accurate, or fifty percent? That way I can prioritize my outreach accordingly.

**Interviewer:** Those are great suggestions. Okay, let's talk about the future. Where do you see your sourcing stack going in the next year or two?

**Emily Martinez:** I think we're going to continue with Greenhouse as our ATS—we're pretty locked in there. But I think we're going to be more strategic about our sourcing tools. Instead of trying to find one tool that does everything, we might use different tools for different purposes. Like, maybe we keep Juicebox for the filtering and saved filter functionality, but we add something like GEM for the sequencing and automation.

**Tom Bradley:** I'd also like to explore more AI-powered tools, but they need to be more mature than what's on the market right now. I want AI that can learn from my behavior and get better over time. Like, if I keep selecting certain types of candidates and passing on others, the AI should pick up on those patterns and adjust its recommendations.

**Interviewer:** That's interesting. So you're not anti-AI, you just want AI that's more adaptive and transparent?

**Tom Bradley:** Exactly. I think AI has huge potential for sourcing. It's just that the current implementations aren't quite there yet, at least not for the way I work.

**Emily Martinez:** And I think we also need to invest more in training and best practices. Tom's saved filter approach is amazing, but it's only amazing because he's put in the time to build out those personas and understand what works. We need to figure out how to replicate that across the team without everyone having to start from scratch.

**Interviewer:** So maybe having templates or starter personas that people can customize?

**Emily Martinez:** Yeah, exactly. Or even just documentation of Tom's approach so other people can learn from it. We're a pretty collaborative team, but we could be better about sharing these kinds of insights.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Okay, last few questions. If you were talking to a peer at another company who's evaluating their sourcing stack, what advice would you give them?

**Tom Bradley:** I'd say don't underestimate the power of good filters and saved searches. A lot of people focus on the sexy AI features, but sometimes the unsexy stuff—like being able to save and reuse your filters—is what actually makes you productive.

**Emily Martinez:** I'd say start with your actual pain points, not what the vendors are selling. Like, what's actually slowing you down? Is it finding candidates? Is it outreach? Is it pipeline management? Different tools solve different problems, so you need to know what your problem is first.

**Interviewer:** Great advice. And last question: if we were to reconnect in six months, what would have to be true for you to feel like you've made progress on this sourcing challenge?

**Emily Martinez:** I'd want to see our time-to-fill numbers come down, especially for hard-to-fill roles like senior engineers and designers. And I'd want to see higher engagement rates on our outreach—more replies, more interest.

**Tom Bradley:** I'd want to feel less tool fatigue. Right now, I'm juggling so many different platforms, and it's exhausting. If we could consolidate or integrate better, that would be a win.

**Emily Martinez:** And I'd want the whole team to be using a persona-based approach like Tom's. If we could get everyone thinking that way and using saved filter sets, I think we'd see a huge improvement in quality of candidates.

**Interviewer:** That's really helpful. Well, thank you both so much for your time. This has been super insightful. I really appreciate your candor and all the specific examples.

**Emily Martinez:** Of course! Happy to help.

**Tom Bradley:** Yeah, anytime. Good luck with your research.

**Interviewer:** Thanks! We'll be in touch.
