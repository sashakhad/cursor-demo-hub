## Opening

**Interviewer**: Hey Patricia, Derek - thanks so much for making time today. I know you're both probably juggling a million things. I'm Michael from Jewel's product team, and we're doing some research to understand how recruiting teams in fintech are approaching technical sourcing these days. Maybe we can start with quick intros?

**Patricia Coleman (Head of Talent Acquisition)**: Yeah, of course! I'm Patricia Coleman, Head of TA here at Affirm. I've been here about three and a half years now, came over from Square actually. Small world in fintech recruiting. My team is... let's see, right now we're at 12 recruiters, down from 18 about a year ago. You know, market conditions and all that.

**Derek Foster (Staff Technical Recruiter)**: Derek Foster, Staff Technical Recruiter. I focus on our engineering roles, primarily backend and mobile. I've been at Affirm for almost five years, so I've seen us grow from about 300 employees to where we are now, which is around 1,800. Lots of changes.

**Interviewer**: That's quite a journey. And I know the fintech market has been... interesting lately. How's recruiting volume looking for you right now?

**Patricia Coleman**: It's definitely slowed from the peak. In 2021, 2022, we were hiring like crazy. Now we're being a lot more strategic. I'd say we're filling maybe 15 to 20 engineering roles per quarter, down from 40-plus at our peak. But the roles we are hiring for are critical, so we still need to be effective.

**Derek Foster**: And the bar has gone up, honestly. We're being much more selective. Every hire has to be a strong yes now, whereas before we might have taken a few more risks.

**Interviewer**: Makes sense. Let's talk about your tech stack. What are you working with today for recruiting?

**Patricia Coleman**: So we're a Greenhouse shop for our ATS. We've been on Greenhouse since I joined, and before that too. For sourcing, we use a mix of tools. We have LinkedIn Recruiter, obviously - that's kind of the baseline. We also use Juicebox, which we added about two years ago. And then we have a small pilot with Jewel that the testing team is running.

**Derek Foster**: The Juicebox thing is interesting. We brought that in because the pricing is more budget-friendly than LinkedIn, especially with the team size we have now. It's been... fine. Not amazing, but it does the job for certain types of roles.

**Patricia Coleman**: Yeah, and then the Jewel pilot - that's been running for maybe four months? Just a couple of people using it, mainly for dashboards and analytics. We haven't fully explored the sourcing features yet. That's part of why we wanted to talk to you, to understand better what we're paying for.

**Interviewer**: Got it. And you mentioned budget is a consideration. Is that a major factor right now in your tool decisions?

**Patricia Coleman**: Oh, absolutely. Look, we're still a public company in growth mode, but we're also being much more disciplined about spend. Every tool we have, we're asking "What's the ROI? Could we get by with less? Where can we consolidate?" It's a different environment than two years ago.

**Derek Foster**: Which is fine, we get it. But it does mean we need to be smart about the tools we use. We can't have five different sourcing tools that all kind of do the same thing. We need to pick our stack and make it work.

## Current State Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's dig into how you're sourcing today. Walk me through your typical workflow when a new engineering req comes in.

**Derek Foster**: Okay, so I'll get a req, I'll do an intake with the hiring manager. Let's say it's a backend engineer role on our consumer credit platform. First thing I do is check our ATS - do we have anyone in our database from previous searches or applicants who might be a fit? That's the easy win if it happens.

**Patricia Coleman**: Which it usually doesn't, to be honest. Our applicant flow is okay, but it's not strong enough that we can fill roles from inbound alone. We need to source proactively for probably 70% of our engineering roles.

**Derek Foster**: Right. So then I go to LinkedIn Recruiter. I'll build a search - location, skills, company filters, that kind of thing. For consumer credit roles, I'm looking for people who have fintech experience, ideally in lending or payments. Maybe they've worked at companies like SoFi, LendingClub, Klarna, other buy-now-pay-later companies.

**Interviewer**: How long does that initial sourcing take?

**Derek Foster**: For a role like that, I'm probably spending... I don't know, six to eight hours building the initial pipeline. I want to get to 40 to 50 qualified candidates before I start reaching out. Then I'll batch my outreach, personalize the messages, and see who responds.

**Patricia Coleman**: And response rates have gone down. A few years ago, Derek might get 30 to 40% response rate on cold outreach. Now it's more like 15 to 20%. People are getting bombarded with recruiting messages.

**Derek Foster**: Yeah, and email deliverability is an issue. I'd say 10 to 15% of the contact data I get bounces. Wrong email address, person changed jobs, email format changed, whatever. So I'm constantly having to hunt down updated contact info.

**Interviewer**: That's frustrating. How are you handling that?

**Derek Foster**: Manually, mostly. I'll Google them, check their GitHub, look at their personal website if they have one. Sometimes I'll try variations of email formats. It's time-consuming but necessary.

**Patricia Coleman**: And this is where tools like Juicebox come in. They claim to have fresher contact data, quarterly refreshes, that sort of thing. In practice... it's a little better than LinkedIn, but not dramatically. We're still seeing bounce rates in the 10% range.

**Interviewer**: And you mentioned you're using both LinkedIn and Juicebox. How do you decide which tool to use for which roles?

**Derek Foster**: Honestly, it's a bit ad hoc. LinkedIn has better data at the senior level, I think. If I'm looking for a Staff or Principal engineer, I start with LinkedIn. For more mid-level roles, Juicebox is fine and it's cheaper per seat, so we use that.

**Patricia Coleman**: We also just don't have enough LinkedIn seats for everyone. We have five seats for 12 recruiters, so people are sharing. Juicebox gives us more coverage for the team.

**Interviewer**: Interesting. Let's talk about the types of roles you're recruiting for. It sounds like consumer credit engineering is one area. What else?

**Derek Foster**: So there are a few main categories. Consumer credit engineering is a big one - these are folks building our underwriting systems, our credit decisioning platforms, our risk models. They need to understand consumer credit, fintech, often some machine learning or data science background.

**Patricia Coleman**: Then we have mobile engineers working on our consumer app and our merchant app. Very different skill sets. The consumer app is about beautiful UI, smooth user experience, offline capability. The merchant app is more about POS integration, reliability, transaction processing.

**Derek Foster**: Payment processing engineers are another category. These folks are working on our payments infrastructure, integrating with payment networks, handling transaction routing, managing fraud detection. It's highly regulated, lots of compliance requirements.

**Patricia Coleman**: And then underwriting platform engineers, which is kind of a subcategory but important. These are people building the systems that determine who gets approved for a loan and at what terms. Lots of regulatory considerations, integration with credit bureaus, real-time decisioning.

**Interviewer**: So you've got at least four distinct profiles there. How different are these from a sourcing perspective?

**Derek Foster**: Pretty different. Like, a mobile engineer with consumer fintech experience - I'm looking for people from companies like Cash App, Venmo, Robinhood, PayPal. People who understand consumer financial apps. They need iOS or Android experience, understanding of mobile security, probably some experience with offline-first architecture.

But a payment processing engineer? Totally different. I'm looking at backgrounds from companies like Stripe, Adyen, Braintree, Square. They need to understand payment networks, PCI compliance, transaction processing, maybe some experience with payment orchestration.

**Patricia Coleman**: And the risk modeling engineers are often coming from more data science or ML backgrounds. They might be at other fintech lenders, or at credit bureaus like Experian or TransUnion, or at fraud detection companies. Different career path entirely.

**Interviewer**: And how are you managing these different search profiles? Are you saving these somewhere?

**Derek Foster**: I have a Google Doc. Literally a Google Doc where I keep my best Boolean strings and filter combinations for different role types. It's not ideal, but it's what I've got.

**Patricia Coleman**: This is actually one of the pain points we were hoping to talk about. We don't have a good way to save and reuse complex filter sets. Every time Derek has a mobile engineer req, he's rebuilding the search or copying from his Google Doc. There's no standardization across the team.

**Derek Foster**: And if another recruiter picks up a mobile role, they might build a completely different search. We're not sharing knowledge effectively.

## Pain Points Exploration

**Interviewer**: Let's dig into that. It sounds like the inability to save and reuse complex filter combinations is a real issue. Tell me more about how that shows up day-to-day.

**Derek Foster**: Okay, so let me give you a concrete example. A couple months ago, we were hiring for a mobile engineer on our consumer app. I need someone with iOS experience, Swift, consumer fintech background, understanding of financial security requirements, experience with offline-first architecture because our app needs to work even when connectivity is spotty.

So I build this whole search in LinkedIn. I've got keywords around iOS, Swift, financial apps, security, offline capabilities. I've got company filters for Cash App, Venmo, Robinhood, PayPal, Chime, Dave, all these consumer fintech companies. I've got location filters for where we're hiring. It takes me a couple hours to dial it in just right.

**Patricia Coleman**: And then you fill the role, and three months later you have another mobile req.

**Derek Foster**: Exactly! And I can't just pull up that search. LinkedIn's saved searches are pretty basic. So I'm going back to my Google Doc, copying the Boolean string, rebuilding the filters. If I've refined the search since I last documented it, that knowledge is lost.

**Interviewer**: And this is different for each role type?

**Derek Foster**: Completely. Like, for a payment processing engineer, my search is totally different. I'm looking for experience with payment APIs, payment gateways, transaction processing. Keywords like Stripe, payment orchestration, PCI compliance, payment networks, ACH, card processing.

Company filters are different too - I want people from Stripe, Square, Adyen, Braintree, PayPal on the infrastructure side, maybe some folks from the payment networks themselves like Visa or Mastercard's technology divisions.

**Patricia Coleman**: And the risk modeling engineers are yet another profile. There, Derek needs to filter for people with strong quantitative backgrounds, machine learning experience, understanding of credit risk models, experience with alternative data sources.

**Derek Foster**: Right, so I'm looking at companies like ZestAI, Upstart, other fintech lenders doing ML-based underwriting, maybe some folks from the traditional credit bureaus, maybe some from fraud detection companies like Sift or Riskified. Completely different pool.

**Interviewer**: How many of these distinct profiles would you say you're managing?

**Derek Foster**: I mean, at least four or five just for the roles I handle. Mobile engineers split into iOS and Android sometimes, because the skill sets and communities are a bit different. Backend engineers split into different specializations. It adds up fast.

**Patricia Coleman**: And across the whole team, we're probably managing 15 to 20 distinct sourcing profiles. Engineering roles, product roles, design roles, data roles. Each one needs its own approach.

**Interviewer**: What would it look like if you had a tool that let you save these complex filter sets and reuse them?

**Derek Foster**: Oh man, that would be huge. First, it would save me probably five to ten hours per req. Instead of rebuilding the search every time, I just pull up my saved "Consumer Fintech Mobile Engineer" filter set and boom, I've got my candidates.

**Patricia Coleman**: Second, it would create consistency across the team. If Derek has figured out the best way to source mobile engineers, other recruiters could use that same filter set. We'd be sharing best practices systematically instead of through Google Docs and Slack messages.

**Derek Foster**: And third, we could iterate and improve over time. If I refine a search and figure out better company filters or better keywords, I update the saved filter set once and it's available to everyone. It's like version control for sourcing strategies.

**Interviewer**: That's a great way to put it. Are there other pain points with your current sourcing workflow?

**Patricia Coleman**: Data quality is a big one. Like we mentioned, bounce rates on email are frustrating. But it's also just outdated information. We'll reach out to someone and they'll say "I left that company six months ago" or "I switched to a different role." LinkedIn's data isn't always current.

**Derek Foster**: Phone numbers are even worse. I'd say 30 to 40% of phone numbers in LinkedIn are wrong or outdated. Which is fine, I mostly do email outreach anyway, but it's another data quality issue.

**Patricia Coleman**: And then there's the engagement tracking piece. In Greenhouse, I can see that Derek sent an outreach email, but I can't easily see if the person opened it, clicked any links, engaged with our content. I'm flying blind on whether my outreach is actually reaching people.

**Derek Foster**: Juicebox has some email tracking features, which is nice. I can at least see open rates. But it's not integrated with Greenhouse, so I'm looking at data in two different places.

**Interviewer**: How are you thinking about the Jewel pilot in the context of these pain points?

**Patricia Coleman**: Honestly, we haven't fully explored it yet. The testing team has been using it for analytics - they like the dashboards, they like being able to visualize their pipeline and see metrics. But we haven't really dug into the sourcing features or the CRM functionality.

**Derek Foster**: Part of that is just bandwidth. We're all stretched thin. Learning a new tool takes time and mental energy. If we're going to invest in that, we need to be confident it's going to solve real problems for us.

**Patricia Coleman**: And we're also thinking about budget and consolidation. We currently have LinkedIn, Juicebox, and this Jewel pilot. Do we need three sourcing tools? Probably not. Can we consolidate to one or two that meet our needs? That's what we're trying to figure out.

**Interviewer**: That makes a lot of sense. What would Jewel need to do to become your primary sourcing tool? What would make you say "Okay, we can move our sourcing workflow from LinkedIn and Juicebox to Jewel"?

**Derek Foster**: For me, it's about filter sophistication and saved searches. Can I build the complex filter sets I need for each role type, save them, reuse them, share them with the team? That's the killer feature for me.

**Patricia Coleman**: Fresh contact data is important. If Jewel's data is materially better than what we're getting from LinkedIn and Juicebox - fewer bounces, more current information - that's a strong value prop.

**Derek Foster**: And integration with Greenhouse. I need to be able to push candidates directly into our ATS, sync activity, see everything in one place. If I'm working across multiple tools and manually moving data around, that's a non-starter.

**Patricia Coleman**: Budget is a real factor too. We're not a massive company, we're watching our spend. What's the pricing model? Is it per seat? Per user? Usage-based? We need it to make sense financially, especially if we're going to consolidate other tools.

## Competitive Landscape

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about the other tools you're using or have evaluated. You mentioned LinkedIn and Juicebox. How do you think about the landscape?

**Patricia Coleman**: LinkedIn is the 800-pound gorilla, right? Everyone uses it, everyone knows it, the data coverage is comprehensive. But it's expensive, the interface hasn't really innovated in years, and the AI features they've added aren't that impressive.

**Derek Foster**: Yeah, LinkedIn Recruiter is fine, but it feels stagnant. They have such a monopoly that they don't have to innovate. The search functionality is basically what it was five years ago.

**Patricia Coleman**: Juicebox came in as a more budget-friendly alternative. Their pitch was "We're like LinkedIn but cheaper, with fresher data." And to their credit, they are cheaper. I think we're paying about $300 per seat per month for Juicebox versus $800 to $900 for LinkedIn Recruiter.

**Derek Foster**: The data is... okay. It's not dramatically better than LinkedIn, but it's not worse. The interface is more modern, which is nice. The saved filter feature is actually pretty good - I can save searches more easily than in LinkedIn.

**Interviewer**: So Juicebox has saved filter functionality that you like?

**Derek Foster**: Yeah, to a degree. I can save a search and pull it up again, which is better than LinkedIn. But it's still not as sophisticated as what I'd want. I can't easily share my saved searches with the team, I can't add notes about when to use each filter set, I can't organize them into categories. It's a basic saved search feature.

**Patricia Coleman**: And coverage can be spotty for really senior or niche roles. For a generic backend engineer, Juicebox is fine. For a Principal Engineer who's an expert in credit risk models, LinkedIn probably has better data.

**Interviewer**: What about other tools? Have you looked at anything else?

**Derek Foster**: We looked at Greenhouse's AI sourcing when they released it. It's bundled with the ATS, which is appealing from a "single vendor" perspective. But the feedback from folks who've used it is mixed. It's very automated - the AI finds candidates and reaches out on your behalf - but the quality of the matches isn't always great.

**Patricia Coleman**: And I'm philosophically a little skeptical of fully automated sourcing. I think recruiting is a relationship-driven profession. I want tools that make me more efficient, but I don't want to completely outsource the candidate identification and outreach to an AI that might not understand the nuance of what we're looking for.

**Derek Foster**: Plus, for specialized roles, I'm not confident an AI is going to understand the difference between a mobile engineer with consumer fintech experience and a mobile engineer with e-commerce experience. Those are different profiles, different backgrounds, different skill sets.

**Interviewer**: That's interesting. So you want tools that augment your expertise, not replace it.

**Patricia Coleman**: Exactly. Give me better filters, fresher data, time-saving features, analytics. But I want to be the one making the decisions about who to reach out to and how to message them.

**Interviewer**: Are there any other tools on your radar?

**Derek Foster**: We've heard about Fetcher, which is more of a sourcing-as-a-service model. They have a team that sources for you. That doesn't really fit our model - we have recruiters, we want them to own sourcing. And it's more expensive.

**Patricia Coleman**: There's a bunch of smaller tools - SeekOut, Hiretual, various scrapers and data providers. We haven't seriously evaluated any of them. At a certain point, we need to make a decision and not spend all our time in tool evaluations.

**Interviewer**: What about the Jewel analytics features your testing team is using? How's that going?

**Patricia Coleman**: That's actually been a bright spot. The dashboards are intuitive, the data visualizations are clear, and it's way easier than building custom reports in Greenhouse. Our testing lead has been using it to track their pipeline, see conversion rates at each stage, identify bottlenecks.

**Derek Foster**: I've looked at it a bit. I like being able to see my sourcing effectiveness metrics - how many candidates I'm sourcing per role, what my response rates are, how long it takes from first outreach to phone screen. That visibility is helpful.

**Patricia Coleman**: So the analytics piece is promising. The question is whether the sourcing features are strong enough to justify consolidating our stack around Jewel.

**Interviewer**: And that brings us back to those key questions - saved filter sets, data quality, Greenhouse integration, pricing. Those are the core factors in your decision.

**Patricia Coleman**: Yeah, exactly. If Jewel can nail those, there's a real opportunity for you to become our primary sourcing platform. If not, we'll probably stick with the LinkedIn + Juicebox combo and just use Jewel for analytics.

## Future Needs & Closing

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about future needs. If you're thinking six to twelve months out, what does your ideal sourcing workflow look like?

**Derek Foster**: I want a single platform where I can do all my sourcing, not three different tools. I want to be able to build sophisticated filters for each role type, save them, reuse them, share them with the team. I want fresh contact data with low bounce rates. I want to be able to track engagement - did the person open my email, click on anything, engage with our content?

**Patricia Coleman**: I want integration with our ATS so data flows seamlessly. I want analytics that help me understand what's working and what's not - which sourcing approaches are most effective, which recruiters are doing well, where we should invest more time. And I want all of this at a reasonable price point.

**Derek Foster**: CRM features would be great too. I meet a lot of people who aren't right for the current role but might be perfect for something later. I need a way to keep track of those relationships, set reminders to follow up, see the history of our interactions.

**Patricia Coleman**: And we need mobile access. Recruiters are on the go, at conferences, at recruiting events. Being able to source and engage candidates from a phone or tablet is important.

**Interviewer**: Those are all helpful. Let's talk about the decision-making process. If you were to consolidate your sourcing stack around Jewel, what would that process look like?

**Patricia Coleman**: First, we'd need to fully evaluate the sourcing features. We've been using the analytics, but we haven't really put the sourcing module through its paces. Derek and a couple other recruiters would need to use it for real reqs, build searches, reach out to candidates, see how it performs.

**Derek Foster**: I'd want to run it in parallel with LinkedIn for a month or two. Take the same role, build searches in both tools, compare the candidate quality and response rates. That would give us real data to make a decision.

**Patricia Coleman**: Then it's a budget conversation. What would it cost to move our whole team to Jewel? Can we negotiate on pricing based on seat count? What's the contract length and terms? We'd need to run the numbers and see if it makes financial sense.

**Derek Foster**: And implementation - how long does it take to get everyone up and running? What's the training requirement? What's the support model? We can't have recruiters being unproductive for weeks while they learn a new tool.

**Patricia Coleman**: Realistically, if we made the decision to move forward, we're probably talking about a three to six month timeline from decision to full rollout. That includes contract negotiation, implementation, training, and a phased rollout to the team.

**Interviewer**: And what's the budget environment like right now? You mentioned earlier that you're being thoughtful about spend.

**Patricia Coleman**: We are, but we're not in a "cut everything" mode. We're being strategic. If a tool genuinely makes us more efficient and effective, we'll find the budget. But we need to see ROI. We can't afford to have tools that aren't being used or aren't delivering value.

**Derek Foster**: And honestly, if we can consolidate from three tools to one or two, that might be net neutral or even a cost savings, depending on pricing. That's an easier conversation with leadership than "We need to add another tool on top of what we have."

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. Last question for both of you - if you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your current sourcing process, what would it be?

**Derek Foster**: Saved filter sets that I can reuse and share across the team. That's the one thing that would save me the most time and make me most effective. I've done the work to figure out how to source mobile engineers with consumer fintech experience. I should be able to codify that knowledge and share it, not rebuild it every time.

**Patricia Coleman**: For me, it's data quality. If I could trust that the contact information is current and accurate, if I could eliminate all these bouncebacks and wrong emails and outdated phone numbers, that would save our team so much time and frustration. Data quality isn't sexy, but it's foundational.

**Interviewer**: Those are both really clear pain points. I think we can help with both of those, and I'd love to set up some time for Derek and maybe a couple other recruiters to really dig into our sourcing features and see how they compare to what you're using today.

**Patricia Coleman**: That sounds great. I think we're at the point where we need to either fully commit to exploring Jewel or make a decision that it's not the right fit. A hands-on evaluation would help us get there.

**Derek Foster**: Yeah, I'm definitely open to it. I want to see how the saved filter functionality works, test the data quality, try the Greenhouse integration. Give me a couple weeks of real-world usage and I'll have a good sense of whether it meets our needs.

**Interviewer**: Perfect. I'll follow up with some times for a deeper product session, and we can get you set up with fuller access to test the sourcing features. And I'll also send over some information on pricing and contract terms so you can start thinking through the budget piece.

**Patricia Coleman**: Great, that's helpful. Thanks for taking the time to understand our situation. It's been a good conversation.

**Derek Foster**: Yeah, appreciate it. Looking forward to testing things out.

**Interviewer**: Thank you both. I'll be in touch soon.
