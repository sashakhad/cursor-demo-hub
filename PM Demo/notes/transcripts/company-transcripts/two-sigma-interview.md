## Opening

**Interviewer**: Thanks so much for making time today. I know you all have packed schedules. Maybe we could start with introductions?

**Rachel Kim (VP of Talent Acquisition)**: Sure, happy to. I'm Rachel Kim, VP of Talent Acquisition at Two Sigma. I've been with the firm for about nine years - started on the recruiting team and moved into this leadership role about four years ago. I oversee all of our talent acquisition globally, which right now is about 35 recruiters across New York, London, Hong Kong, and a few other locations.

**Steven Chen (Lead Technical Recruiter - ML Engineering)**: I'm Steven Chen, Lead Technical Recruiter focused on machine learning engineering. Been at Two Sigma for six years. Before this I was at Google Brain, so I came from the ML research world into recruiting for it.

**Emily Zhang (Quantitative Research Recruiter)**: Emily Zhang. I recruit for our quantitative research roles - the folks developing trading strategies, doing fundamental research with quantitative methods, building models. I've been here for five years, came from Jane Street before that.

**Interviewer**: Great context. Can you give me a sense of hiring volume at Two Sigma?

**Rachel Kim**: We're hiring at pretty significant scale. Probably 400 to 500 people annually firm-wide. Of that, I'd say 50 to 60% are technology and data science roles - machine learning engineers, data scientists, software engineers, platform engineers. Another 20 to 25% are quantitative research roles. The rest is operations, business development, client service, corporate functions.

**Steven Chen**: On the ML engineering side, which is what I focus on, we're probably filling 80 to 100 roles per year. It's a big part of our hiring.

**Emily Zhang**: Quantitative research is maybe 60 to 80 roles annually. Not as high volume as ML engineering, but very specialized and high touch.

**Interviewer**: What does your recruiting tech stack look like today?

**Rachel Kim**: We use Greenhouse as our ATS. We've been on it for about five years and it works well for applicant tracking. For sourcing, we use Jewel pretty heavily - we've been customers for probably three years now. We also have LinkedIn Recruiter licenses for everyone, though we use it less than we used to now that we have Jewel. And we work with some executive search firms for very senior roles.

**Interviewer**: So you're already a Jewel customer. How did that relationship start?

**Rachel Kim**: We were looking for a more sophisticated sourcing tool. LinkedIn was fine for general searches but we needed something that could handle the complexity of our recruiting - the highly specialized roles, the need for advanced filtering, relationship management for passive candidates. We evaluated a few options and decided to pilot Jewel. The pilot went well, so we rolled it out to the full team.

**Steven Chen**: I was part of that initial pilot. The saved search functionality and the ability to build really complex filters was what sold me on it.

**Emily Zhang**: Same. For quant research recruiting, I need to be able to layer in multiple criteria - education, publications, company background, specific skills. Jewel made that much easier than LinkedIn.

## Current State Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's dig into how you use Jewel today. Steven, can you walk me through a typical ML engineering search?

**Steven Chen**: Sure. So machine learning engineering at Two Sigma is quite diverse. We have ML engineers working on a lot of different applications - NLP for alternative data, computer vision for satellite imagery analysis, reinforcement learning for execution algorithms, time series forecasting for trading signals, deep learning for portfolio construction. Each of these requires somewhat different backgrounds and expertise.

**Interviewer**: How do you structure your searches to account for that?

**Steven Chen**: I've built what I call persona-based saved searches in Jewel. So I have a saved search for NLP engineers, a separate one for computer vision engineers, one for reinforcement learning specialists, one for time series forecasting, and so on. Each has different keyword combinations, different company filters, different publication signals.

**Interviewer**: Can you give me an example? What does the NLP search look like?

**Steven Chen**: Sure. For NLP engineers, I'm filtering for candidates with strong backgrounds in natural language processing - that means keywords like "NLP," "natural language processing," "transformers," "BERT," "GPT," "text mining," "information extraction." I'm looking for people who've published at NLP conferences - ACL, EMNLP, NAACL. I'm looking at companies known for strong NLP work - Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, Anthropic.

**Rachel Kim**: And then education background - often PhDs in computer science with NLP focus, or computational linguistics.

**Steven Chen**: Exactly. So all of those criteria are saved in my NLP engineer search. When I have an NLP role, I pull up that search, maybe tweak it slightly for the specific requirements of that role, and I have a strong candidate pool pretty quickly.

**Interviewer**: And you have separate searches for other ML specializations?

**Steven Chen**: Yeah. For computer vision engineers, the search is completely different. Now I'm looking for "computer vision," "image processing," "object detection," "image segmentation," "convolutional neural networks." Publications at CVPR, ICCV, ECCV. Companies like Google (especially Google Maps or Google Photos teams), Facebook, Tesla, Waymo, NVIDIA. Different skill set, different research background, different companies.

**Emily Zhang**: This is exactly the kind of complexity I deal with in quant research too.

**Steven Chen**: Right. For reinforcement learning, it shifts again - "reinforcement learning," "RL," "Q-learning," "policy gradients," "deep RL," "multi-agent systems." Publications at ICML, NeurIPS, specific RL workshops. Companies like DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Brain, maybe game companies that do RL work.

**Interviewer**: So you've essentially built a library of these specialized searches?

**Steven Chen**: Exactly. I probably have 15 to 20 saved searches for different ML specializations. And the value is that I've refined these over years. I know which keywords work, which companies are good sources, what educational backgrounds correlate with success. All of that knowledge is captured in these saved searches, and I can reuse them across multiple roles.

**Rachel Kim**: This is one of the reasons Jewel has been valuable for us. Before, recruiters were rebuilding searches for every req. Now we can build them once, save them, refine them over time.

**Interviewer**: Emily, can you walk me through how you use Jewel for quant research?

**Emily Zhang**: Sure. So quant research at Two Sigma covers a pretty wide range. We have people developing systematic trading strategies, people doing fundamental analysis enhanced by data science, people building execution algorithms, people working on portfolio construction and risk management. Each of these is a different persona with different sourcing approaches.

**Interviewer**: How have you structured your saved searches?

**Emily Zhang**: Similar to Steven - I have persona-based searches. Let me give you a few examples. I have a search for ML researchers with finance background. These are people with deep machine learning expertise who are applying it to financial problems. They often have PhDs in computer science or statistics, publications in ML conferences, and either they've worked at other quantitative finance firms or they're coming from academia or tech companies.

**Steven Chen**: There's actually overlap between some of Emily's ML researcher searches and my ML engineering searches, which is useful because we can share knowledge.

**Emily Zhang**: Right. So that search is filtering for PhD in CS or statistics, ML publications, keywords like "machine learning," "quantitative finance," "systematic trading," "portfolio optimization." Companies include other hedge funds - Renaissance, Citadel, DE Shaw - or ML teams at tech companies.

Another major persona is quantitative developers - these are the folks implementing trading strategies in production code. They need strong programming skills, usually C++ or Python, plus solid quantitative background. Often they have master's or PhDs in quantitative fields - math, physics, CS, financial engineering.

**Interviewer**: And the search criteria is different?

**Emily Zhang**: Yeah. Now I'm looking for programming skills plus quantitative keywords - "C++," "Python," "quantitative trading," "systematic trading," "backtesting," "alpha generation," "statistical arbitrage." Companies shift more toward hedge funds specifically, or quantitative roles at investment banks.

A third persona is data scientists with financial modeling experience. These folks are analyzing datasets to generate trading signals, building statistical models, doing exploratory data analysis. They need strong statistics and data science skills, programming in Python or R, and understanding of financial markets.

**Rachel Kim**: And they're often coming from different backgrounds than the ML researchers or quant developers.

**Emily Zhang**: Exactly. More diverse backgrounds - might have PhDs in statistics or economics, might be coming from analytics roles at tech companies, might be from consulting firms like McKinsey or BCG that do quantitative work, or from other asset managers. The search focuses on "data science," "statistical modeling," "Python," "R," "financial analysis," "quantitative research."

**Interviewer**: So you're managing multiple distinct personas within quant research, each with its own saved search?

**Emily Zhang**: At least five or six major ones, yeah. And like Steven said, the value is that these are refined over time. I've learned what works - which keywords surface the best candidates, which companies are good sources, which educational backgrounds correlate with success at Two Sigma. That knowledge is captured in the saved searches.

**Interviewer**: How does this compare to how you were sourcing before Jewel?

**Rachel Kim**: Night and day, honestly. Before Jewel, recruiters were building searches from scratch for every role, or maintaining complex Boolean strings in Word documents. It was inefficient and inconsistent.

**Steven Chen**: I had a document with probably 20 different Boolean search strings that I'd copy-paste into LinkedIn. It worked, but it was clunky. And if someone new joined the team, they couldn't easily leverage my years of learning.

**Emily Zhang**: Now we can share saved searches across the team. If I've built a great search for ML researchers with finance backgrounds, Steven can use it too if he has a similar role. We can collaborate and refine searches together.

**Interviewer**: What other Jewel features are you using heavily?

**Rachel Kim**: The CRM functionality has been really valuable. We do a lot of relationship building with passive candidates - people who aren't actively looking but might be open to the right opportunity. The CRM helps us track those relationships over time.

**Emily Zhang**: Yeah, for quant research especially, candidates are often not actively job searching. I might talk to someone at Renaissance who's happy there but interested in Two Sigma's approach. I'll add them to the CRM, stay in touch periodically, and then when they're ready to explore, we've already built that relationship.

**Steven Chen**: The analytics are helpful too. I can see which sources are yielding the best candidates, which outreach messages get the best response rates, how my pipeline is trending over time.

## Pain Points Exploration

**Interviewer**: So it sounds like Jewel has been working well. What challenges are you still facing? What could be better?

**Rachel Kim**: I think we're generally happy with Jewel, but there are always areas for improvement. Data freshness is one - contact information goes stale, people change jobs and it's not reflected immediately in the database.

**Steven Chen**: Yeah, I'd say maybe 10 to 15% of the time, contact info bounces or the person has moved companies. It's not a huge issue but it's noticeable.

**Emily Zhang**: For very senior or very niche roles, coverage can be patchy. Like if I'm recruiting for a very specialized quant role, there might only be 30 or 40 people in the world who are qualified, and Jewel might only have contact info for half of them. LinkedIn has similar issues though.

**Rachel Kim**: Integration with Greenhouse could be smoother. We can push candidates from Jewel to Greenhouse, but it's not completely seamless. There's some manual work involved.

**Steven Chen**: I'd love to see more sophisticated AI features. Like, could Jewel learn from my successful hires and automatically surface similar candidates? Or could it suggest keywords or companies I might not have thought of based on patterns in my searches?

**Emily Zhang**: And I'd like better ways to track why certain searches work. Like, I have a saved search for ML researchers that works really well, but I'm not always sure which specific criteria are most important. More insights into that would help me refine further.

**Interviewer**: What about compared to LinkedIn? How do you think about Jewel versus LinkedIn today?

**Rachel Kim**: We still use LinkedIn, particularly for very senior or executive-level searches where the network effects matter. But for our core technical recruiting, we're primarily using Jewel now.

**Steven Chen**: LinkedIn is fine for broad searches, but Jewel is better for specialized, complex searches. The filtering is more sophisticated, the saved search functionality is more powerful, the UI is cleaner.

**Emily Zhang**: Response rates seem similar between the two. Data quality is comparable. But the efficiency of being able to reuse sophisticated searches makes Jewel more valuable for my workflow.

**Rachel Kim**: We've reduced our LinkedIn Recruiter spend over the past couple years as we've ramped up Jewel usage. We still maintain licenses for the team, but we're using it less intensively.

## Competitive Landscape & Future Needs

**Interviewer**: What other tools have you evaluated over the years?

**Rachel Kim**: Before we went with Jewel, we looked at several options. We evaluated Gem, which is more focused on outbound engagement and sequencing. We looked at SeekOut, which has some interesting features around diversity and contact data. We looked at Hired and some other marketplace models, but those don't fit our needs - we want to control our sourcing, not wait for candidates to come to us.

**Steven Chen**: I've seen demos of some newer AI sourcing tools, but they tend to be too "black box" for my taste. I want to understand why a candidate is being surfaced and have control over the criteria.

**Emily Zhang**: For our specialized roles, I need precision. I can't afford to have an AI surfacing candidates who aren't actually qualified. So I prefer the approach Jewel takes - powerful filtering tools that I control, rather than AI making decisions for me.

**Interviewer**: As you think about the future, what would you want to see from Jewel or your sourcing tools more broadly?

**Steven Chen**: For me, it's continued improvement in data quality and freshness. The more comprehensive the coverage and the more current the contact data, the more effective I can be.

**Emily Zhang**: I'd love even more sophisticated filtering capabilities. Like, can I filter by publications at specific conferences? Can I filter by patents? Can I see contribution patterns on GitHub or other signals of technical depth?

**Rachel Kim**: Better predictive capabilities would be interesting. If Jewel could learn from our successful hires and predict which candidates are most likely to be strong fits, that would be valuable. But it needs to be explainable - I need to understand why it's making those predictions.

**Steven Chen**: Integration with other tools in our stack would be helpful. Right now we're manually moving data between Jewel and Greenhouse and other systems. The more automated that can be, the better.

**Emily Zhang**: And I'd love better collaboration features within the team. Like, if another recruiter has talked to a candidate I'm looking at, I want to see those notes immediately. If someone has insights about a particular company or candidate pool, I want to leverage that.

**Interviewer**: What about budget? How do you think about ROI for recruiting tools?

**Rachel Kim**: We're spending probably $200,000 annually on Jewel for the team. That's meaningful investment, but the ROI is clear. Our recruiters are more efficient - probably 30 to 40% more efficient at sourcing than before Jewel. We're filling roles faster, and we're finding better candidates because we have more sophisticated search capabilities.

**Steven Chen**: If you calculate the time savings alone, it pays for itself. I'm probably saving five to six hours a week on search building and refinement. Multiply that by 35 recruiters, that's substantial.

**Emily Zhang**: And there's the quality dimension. I'm finding candidates I wouldn't have found before because I can build more sophisticated searches. That leads to better hires, which has huge long-term value.

**Rachel Kim**: We also compare ourselves to other quantitative finance firms. From what I hear from peers, we're pretty sophisticated in our sourcing approach. Jewel has been part of that.

**Interviewer**: Are there other firms you benchmark against?

**Rachel Kim**: We talk to peers at Citadel, Renaissance, DE Shaw, Jane Street. Everyone has different setups, but there's a general trend toward more sophisticated sourcing tools and data-driven recruiting. We're all competing for the same small pool of exceptional talent.

**Steven Chen**: The war for talent in ML and quantitative research is intense. Having better tools gives us a competitive advantage.

**Interviewer**: As you think about the next few years, what are your priorities for talent acquisition?

**Rachel Kim**: Continued improvement in efficiency and effectiveness. Can we maintain or improve our quality of hire while scaling up our volume? Can we reduce time-to-fill? Can we build better candidate experiences?

**Emily Zhang**: For quant research specifically, the talent pool is only getting more competitive. Every hedge fund, every tech company, everyone wants the same exceptional ML researchers and quant minds. We need to be more sophisticated in how we source and engage them.

**Steven Chen**: And as ML evolves, the personas we're recruiting for will evolve too. A few years ago, we weren't recruiting for large language model specialists - now that's a major area. Our tools need to be flexible enough to adapt as our needs change.

**Rachel Kim**: That's a good point. The saved search approach in Jewel is helpful there - as new specializations emerge, we can create new searches quickly rather than starting from scratch.

**Interviewer**: This has been really helpful. I appreciate you sharing your experiences with Jewel so candidly. Any final thoughts or feedback for us?

**Steven Chen**: Just keep improving the product. The foundation is strong - the filtering, the saved searches, the CRM. But there's always room for more sophistication, better data, smarter features.

**Emily Zhang**: I'd echo that. And continue listening to customers like us who are recruiting for highly specialized roles. Our needs might be edge cases, but solving for the complex use cases makes the product better for everyone.

**Rachel Kim**: Overall we're happy customers. Jewel has become a core part of our recruiting tech stack. We'd love to continue collaborating on making it even better.

**Interviewer**: That's great to hear. And definitely, we want to keep that feedback loop going. Thanks again for your time, everyone.

**Rachel Kim**: Thanks, Michael.

**Steven Chen**: Thank you.

**Emily Zhang**: Thanks.
