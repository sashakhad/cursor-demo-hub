## Market Snapshot

### The Competitive Landscape in One Minute

**Market Leader (Universal):** LinkedIn Recruiter - 100% adoption, but universally considered insufficient  
**Primary Platform (Technical Recruiting):** Jewel - Strong with power users, praised for saved searches  
**Bundled (Low Adoption):** Greenhouse AI - Poor data quality (33% bounce rate), minimal usage despite being "free"  
**Emerging Challenger:** Juicebox - Budget-friendly, gaining traction with free tier  
**Niche Players:** Gem (CRM), SeekOut (large database), HireEZ (AI features)

## Jewel's Competitive Position

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Saved searches** - "Game changer," "absolutely critical," "can't imagine recruiting without it"
2. **AI intake form** - Major differentiator, accelerates search creation
3. **Data quality** - 12% bounce rate vs. 33% for Greenhouse AI
4. **Clean UX** - "Refreshing" compared to overwhelming alternatives
5. **Analytics** - See which searches convert to hires

### ⚠️ Threats

2. **Juicebox emergence** - Cheaper alternative, good enough for many use cases

4. **Organization gaps** - 12-15+ saved searches become unwieldy
5. **Learning curve** - 1-2 months to proficiency limits adoption speed

## Key Market Insights

### 1. Persona-Based Sourcing is the Killer Use Case
**Every company interviewed** needs to differentiate between role types that appear similar:
- Infrastructure engineers: distributed systems vs. database kernel vs. platform
- Backend engineers: fintech vs. payments vs. risk management vs. fraud
- ML roles: researchers vs. data scientists vs. ML platform engineers

**Winner**: Tool that best supports complex, reusable, shareable persona/filter combinations

### 2. Data Quality is Make-or-Break
Greenhouse AI's 33% bounce rate makes it unusable despite being "free." Companies will pay for tools with better data (Jewel 12%, LinkedIn 8%).

### 3. "Black Box AI" is Rejected
Recruiters want transparency and control. Quotes:
- *"I don't want that. I want tools that make me more efficient, not tools that try to replace my judgment."*
- *"I need to understand why I'm seeing certain candidates. The black box AI thing doesn't work for me."*

### 4. Integration Matters More Than Features
Tool sprawl is real. Ops teams spend 5-10 hours/week just pulling reports from multiple systems.

### 5. Saved Searches are Most Valuable Feature
Power users have 12-15+ saved searches. This feature alone drives switching decisions.

---

## Win/Loss Patterns

### Why Jewel Wins
1. Saved search functionality (cited by 100% of users)
2. AI intake form (faster search creation, better onboarding)
3. Better data quality than Greenhouse AI
4. Clean, intuitive UX
5. Power users become evangelists

### Why Jewel Loses / Is At Risk
1. Budget pressure (need to justify vs. "free" Greenhouse)
2. Juicebox cheaper and "good enough" for some use cases
3. Can't share saved searches across teams
4. Learning curve limits adoption speed
5. Some customers on ATS but not using AI sourcing

## Top 3 Product Opportunities

### 1. 🚀 Shared Persona Library (HIGH IMPACT)
**Problem**: Saved searches are individual, take months to build  
**Solution**: Team library with templates, sharing, and customization  
**Evidence**: Mentioned by 6+ companies as top need  
**Impact**: Accelerates onboarding from 2 months to 2 weeks, captures institutional knowledge

### 2. 🚀 Fresher Data (HIGH IMPACT)
**Problem**: 20-30% of data is stale (quarterly updates insufficient)  
**Solution**: Monthly or real-time updates, freshness indicators  
**Evidence**: Universal pain point across all transcripts  
**Impact**: Major differentiator vs. ALL competitors

### 3. 🚀 Candidate Ranking/Prioritization (HIGH IMPACT)
**Problem**: Good filters still produce 200+ candidates - which to contact first?  
**Solution**: AI-powered ranking with transparent reasoning  
**Evidence**: Mentioned by 4+ companies  
**Impact**: Reduces manual review time by 50%+

## Competitive Threats & Responses

### Threat 1: Greenhouse improves AI sourcing data quality
**Likelihood**: Medium (they're aware of the problem)  
**Response**: Maintain data quality lead, emphasize saved searches advantage  
**Moat**: Power users on Jewel have built 12-15+ personas - switching cost is high

### Threat 2: Juicebox raises funding, improves enterprise features

**Moat**: Enterprise readiness (SOC 2, security) takes 18+ months to build

### Threat 3: LinkedIn builds better saved search functionality
**Likelihood**: Low (their focus is on broad market, not niche recruiting)  
**Response**: Continue specializing in technical recruiting personas  
**Moat**: Deep expertise in technical recruiting workflows

### Threat 4: New AI-native competitor emerges
**Likelihood**: Medium (lots of AI excitement, funding available)  
**Response**: Invest in AI features but maintain transparency/control  
**Moat**: Existing customer relationships and data on what actually works

---

## Bottom Line

**Jewel is well-positioned but needs to execute on 3 key areas:**

1. **Product**: Ship shared persona library + fresher data + candidate ranking
2. **Go-to-Market**: Make ROI crystal clear vs. "free" Greenhouse alternative
3. **Expansion**: Convert existing ATS customers to AI sourcing users

**The market is ripe for disruption of LinkedIn Recruiter's dominance, and Jewel is the strongest challenger. The window is now - before Greenhouse fixes their data quality or Juicebox gets enterprise-ready.**
