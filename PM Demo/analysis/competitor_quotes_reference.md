## Jewel (Primary Product)

### ⭐ Most Powerful Quotes

> *"I basically live in Jewel. I can't imagine recruiting the roles I recruit without it at this point."*  
> — David Kim, Technical Recruiter, Databricks

> *"The saved search functionality is absolutely critical for me."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

> *"Marcus is our Jewel power user. He's like an evangelist for it."*  
> — Sarah Chen, Director of Engineering Recruiting, Stripe

> *"I pretty much live in Jewel for my sourcing. I've been using it for probably a year and a half now, and I just... I can't imagine going back."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Senior Technical Recruiter, Stripe

> *"The AI intake form was a huge selling point for us. It makes the initial search setup so much faster and easier."*  
> — Patricia Chen, Lead Technical Recruiter, Uber

> *"The analytics are huge. I can see which of my saved searches are actually producing candidates who make it through the funnel. So I can optimize my sourcing over time."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

### Feature-Specific Praise

**Saved Searches:**
> *"I have one saved search for backend engineers with fintech experience... Then I have a completely different saved search for platform engineers who need compliance backgrounds. The candidate profiles look totally different."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I probably have... God, I don't know, maybe 15 different saved searches for my various roles? And I can just toggle between them depending on what I'm working on."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

**AI Intake Form:**
> *"Instead of having to manually build out all the filters and Boolean strings, I can just have a conversation with the AI. It asks me questions like, 'What's the role title? What are the must-have skills? What companies should we target?' And based on my answers, it builds out the search for me."*  
> — Amanda Foster, Senior Technical Recruiter, Netflix

> *"For newer members of the team, it's been a game-changer. It helps them ramp up much faster because they don't need to know all the tricks of Boolean search or advanced filtering."*  
> — Jessica Liu, Sourcing Lead, Netflix

**Data Quality:**
> *"Jewel's data seems better. I'm not seeing the same bounce rates. Maybe like 10-15% bounces, which feels more normal. People change jobs, email addresses get deactivated, that's just part of recruiting. But 30% is unacceptable."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"We actually did an analysis of this a few months ago. I pulled data on email bounce rates by source. Greenhouse sourcing was 33%, Jewel was 12%, LinkedIn was like 8%."*  
> — Priya Patel, Recruiting Operations Manager, Stripe

**UX:**
> *"The UX is just clean. It's intuitive, it doesn't feel cluttered. After using tools like SeekOut, which have a million options and toggles, Jewel felt refreshing."*  
> — Carlos Rodriguez, Lead Recruiter, Netflix

### Pain Points / Gaps

> *"I wish there was a way to organize them better. Like, folders or tags or something. So I could have all my payment infrastructure searches in one place."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"It would be amazing if I could share my searches with the team in a more structured way. Right now, I'd have to manually walk them through each search and help them rebuild it."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"It takes time. Like, it might take someone a month or two to really get proficient with Jewel and build out their search library."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

---

## LinkedIn Recruiter

### Why It's Universal but Insufficient

> *"LinkedIn is... LinkedIn. It's expensive but necessary."*  
> — Sarah Chen, Stripe

> *"I use LinkedIn a lot, but more for research than for actual sourcing. For the actual candidate search, I usually start in Jewel because the filtering is better."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

> *"InMail response rates have gone down a lot over the years. I think candidates are just getting so much outreach on LinkedIn that it's harder to break through."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

### Specific Limitations

> *"The filtering limitations are frustrating. Like, I can't really build the complex Boolean searches I want to build."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I can't just search for 'low-latency C++ engineer' because I'll get thousands of results, many of whom aren't the right fit. I need to layer in filters... But LinkedIn's Boolean search gets unwieldy fast."*  
> — Christopher Allen, VP of Technology Recruiting, Goldman Sachs

> *"LinkedIn profiles are notoriously out of date. Someone says they're at Company X but they left six months ago."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

### Cost

> *"We're paying like, I don't even want to say how much, but it's a lot for our license count."*  
> — Sarah Chen, Stripe

> *"It's around $8,500 per seat annually, so yeah, with 25 seats, we're looking at over $200K a year just for LinkedIn."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

---

## Greenhouse AI Sourcing

### 🚨 Data Quality Crisis

> *"The email bounce rates were terrible. I tried it when it first came out, and I'd send these carefully crafted outreach messages to like 20 people, and a third of them would bounce."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"We actually did an analysis... Greenhouse sourcing was 33%, Jewel was 12%, LinkedIn was like 8%. So there's a clear difference in data quality."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

> *"The biggest issue is email bounce rates. We were seeing like 30, 35% of my emails bounce. That's just not usable."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

> *"Our bounce rate with Greenhouse sourcing was 32%. With Jewel it's more like 12 or 13%, which is way more reasonable."*  
> — Alex Rodriguez, Recruiting Operations Lead, Databricks

### Not Sophisticated Enough

> *"The filtering just isn't sophisticated enough for what we need. Like, I can't create the kind of nuanced searches I was talking about."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"The AI was doing keyword matching rather than actually understanding the role."*  
> — Mark Thompson, Uber

> *"It gave me back a bunch of generic backend engineers and some data scientists. But they weren't data platform specialists."*  
> — Mark Thompson, Uber

### UX Problems

> *"It feels like Greenhouse bolted the AI feature onto the existing product rather than building it natively. It's a separate tab, separate workflow. It doesn't integrate smoothly with how we actually work."*  
> — Patricia Chen, Uber

> *"Greenhouse AI was bolted onto Greenhouse as an afterthought rather than being natively integrated."*  
> — Amanda Foster, Netflix

### Overall Verdict

> *"It's not good. Like, not even close to competitive with what other tools are doing."*  
> — Rachel Foster, VP Talent Acquisition, Snowflake

> *"It was pretty clear it wouldn't work for technical recruiting."*  
> — James Wilson, Director of Engineering Recruiting, Snowflake

> *"And it's frustrating because from a budget perspective, those credits are already bundled into our Greenhouse contract. Like, we're paying for them whether we use them or not. But if the data quality isn't there..."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

---

## Juicebox

### Emerging Positive Sentiment

> *"Chris became our Juicebox evangelist."*  
> — Amanda Lewis, Director of Technical Recruiting, Figma

> *"The saved filters feature alone is worth the price of admission for me."*  
> — Chris Johnson, Lead Recruiter, Figma

> *"Juicebox is solid—they were actually a close second for us. But Jewel's AI features tipped the scales. The AI intake form in particular was something Juicebox didn't have at the time."*  
> — Sophia Kim, Manager Technical Recruiting, Uber

### Free Tier Appeal

> *"Some folks discovered Juicebox has a free tier and they started using that for certain roles."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

> *"The free version was actually pretty generous—we got access to the core filtering features and even some saved filters."*  
> — Amanda Lewis, Figma

### Limitations

> *"The free tier is limited to like 50 credits a month? Something like that? So it's not really scalable for the volume we're doing."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I've seen some of the Juicebox results and they're... mixed. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's really off. It feels like the AI isn't quite trained well enough for technical roles yet."*  
> — James Wilson, Snowflake

> *"The challenge is trust. If the AI gives you a list of 50 people, you still have to review every profile to make sure they're actually relevant."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

> *"Juicebox is interesting but feels too early-stage for us to bet on heavily."*  
> — Rachel Foster, Snowflake

---

## SeekOut

### The "Too Complex" Competitor

> *"SeekOut has a huge database, which is appealing. But the interface is overwhelming. There are so many options, so many toggles. It feels like you need a PhD to use it effectively."*  
> — Jessica Liu, Netflix

> *"There are so many options, so many filters, so many toggles. It felt like you'd need weeks of training to use it effectively."*  
> — Sophia Kim, Uber

> *"It felt like it was expensive and the ROI wasn't clear compared to what we were already doing with LinkedIn and Jewel."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

---

## HireEZ (formerly Hiretual)

### Middle-of-the-Road Feedback

> *"I tried HireEZ for a couple months last year. It was... fine? The AI matching stuff was interesting but not amazing. It felt like it was trying to do too much, like it wanted to automate the whole process, but I don't want that."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"HireEZ has some interesting AI features, but when we tested the contact data quality side-by-side, Jewel came out ahead."*  
> — Patricia Chen, Uber

> *"It felt like LinkedIn plus a little bit more. Which is fine, but is it worth the effort of migrating and retraining everyone?"*  
> — James Wilson, Snowflake

### Automation Philosophy Rejection

> *"Some of these tools are positioning themselves as 'AI will find all the candidates for you, you just sit back and review them.' But that's not how I want to work. I want to be actively sourcing."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I want tools that make me more efficient, not tools that try to replace my judgment."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

---

## Gem

### CRM Strength, Sourcing Weakness

> *"Gem is interesting for the sequencing and automation side, but the search and filtering capabilities didn't feel as robust as Jewel. It's like they're optimized for different parts of the funnel."*  
> — Mark Thompson, Uber

> *"The CRM capabilities are strong, but we already have CRM functionality in Jewel, and we didn't want to switch our whole ATS."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

> *"Gem really wants you to be all-in on their platform."*  
> — Sarah Chen, Stripe

> *"We tried Gem for a while but didn't renew."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

---

## Workday

### Enterprise HRIS, Terrible Recruiting

> *"Workday's great for a lot of things, but AI sourcing is not their strength. I think they're playing catch-up there."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

> *"We've looked at it. It's not good. Like, not even close to competitive with what other tools are doing."*  
> — Rachel Foster, Snowflake

> *"It's like keyword matching from 2010. We tried a demo and it was pretty clear it wouldn't work for technical recruiting."*  
> — James Wilson, Snowflake

> *"Workday's strength is the HRIS core - payroll, benefits, org management. That's all great. But recruiting tools, and especially AI sourcing, are not their forte."*  
> — Rachel Foster, Snowflake

---

## Key Market Themes

### Persona-Based Sourcing is Critical

> *"Backend engineer is such a broad category. The search strategy for a ride-sharing backend engineer is completely different from, say, a payments platform engineer or a mapping/geolocation engineer."*  
> — Patricia Chen, Uber

> *"Infrastructure engineer is actually a really broad term... You've got distributed systems engineers... database kernel engineers... cloud platform engineers. They all get lumped under 'infrastructure engineer' in most companies' job descriptions."*  
> — James Wilson, Snowflake

> *"Within quantitative research at Citadel, there are at least six major personas, each requiring completely different sourcing approaches."*  
> — Brandon Lee, Citadel

### Data Staleness is Universal

> *"Data staleness is a big one. We're constantly running into situations where the contact data we have is outdated."*  
> — Jessica Liu, Netflix

> *"I'd say 20-30% of the time you're dealing with stale data in some form."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

> *"I'd estimate 20 to 25% of the contact data we get has some kind of issue."*  
> — Margaret Campbell, Goldman Sachs

### AI Needs Transparency

> *"I need to understand why I'm seeing certain candidates. The black box AI thing doesn't work for me."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I'm not interested in black box AI where I don't understand what it's doing or why. I want AI that augments my work, not replaces my judgment."*  
> — Mark Thompson, Uber

> *"The tools should make me faster and more efficient, but I still want to be the one driving the process."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

### Integration Matters

> *"The amount of time the team spends copying data from one system to another is significant. If everything just flowed seamlessly, that would save us so much time."*  
> — Sarah Chen, Stripe

> *"We've got data in Workday, data in Jewel, data in LinkedIn, data in these random spreadsheets. Getting a unified view of our sourcing funnel is really hard."*  
> — Nina Sharma, Snowflake

> *"I'd love more integration so I can stay in one place. Right now, I've got Jewel open, LinkedIn open, Greenhouse open, my email, Slack. It's a lot of tab-switching."*  
> — Mark Thompson, Uber

## Competitive Win Quotes (Why Jewel Wins)

> *"The ROI on Jewel is there. I filled twelve roles last quarter, and probably nine of them came from my Jewel sourcing. That's real impact."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"If a tool costs us $50,000 a year but it helps us fill 50 roles that we otherwise wouldn't have filled, and each of those roles generates millions in value for Stripe, the ROI is obvious."*  
> — Priya Patel, Stripe

> *"If I can use Jewel to fill 12 roles a quarter instead of 8 roles, that's significant. That's 50% more productivity. You'd hire another recruiter to get that kind of increase, and a recruiter costs way more than a software license."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"The folks who've built out personas and saved filter sets—their response rates are significantly higher, their candidates are better fits, their time-to-fill is faster. It's really compelling data."*  
> — Sophia Kim, Uber

## Most Requested Features (Product Roadmap)

### 1. Shared Persona Library

> *"It would be amazing if I could share my searches with the team in a more structured way... I should be able to just duplicate my search for them with one click."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

> *"I'd love to see Jewel make it easier to share personas across the team. Right now, saved filters are personal—they're tied to my account."*  
> — Carlos Rodriguez, Netflix

> *"It would be such a time-saver. Instead of everyone building personas from scratch, they could start with a template and customize it for their specific needs."*  
> — Patricia Chen, Uber

### 2. Search Organization

> *"I have so many now that it's getting unwieldy. I wish there was a way to organize them better. Like, folders or tags or something."*  
> — Marcus Thompson, Stripe

> *"I wish I could group them into categories or folders. Like, all my distributed systems searches in one folder."*  
> — David Kim, Databricks

### 3. Fresher Data

> *"I'd love monthly updates instead of quarterly. Or even better, real-time updates."*  
> — Chris Johnson, Figma

> *"Show me a timestamp on each candidate profile so I know if the data is fresh or six months old."*  
> — Chris Johnson, Figma

### 4. Candidate Ranking

> *"Even with good filters, you might have two hundred potential candidates. How do you know which ones to reach out to first? We need better ways to rank and prioritize."*  
> — Sophia Kim, Uber

> *"We're often dealing with hundreds of potential candidates for a single role. It would be great to have better ways to prioritize or rank candidates within a result set."*  
> — Amanda Foster, Netflix
