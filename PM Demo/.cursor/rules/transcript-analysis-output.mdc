# Transcript Analysis Commands - Output Rules

When executing analysis commands from `.cursor/commands/` on company transcripts:

## Output Constraints

1. **Single File Output**
   - Create EXACTLY ONE markdown file per command
   - File naming: `{command-number}-{command-name}.md`
   - Example: `01-competitive-insights.md`

2. **Output Location**
   - All outputs go in: `analysis/transcript-analysis-{YYYY-MM-DD}/`
   - Use current date for folder name
   - Example: `analysis/transcript-analysis-2025-10-30/`

3. **Prohibited Actions**
   - ❌ Do NOT create multiple files per command
   - ❌ Do NOT create intermediate files
   - ❌ Do NOT create separate folders per company
   - ❌ Do NOT create backup or draft files
   - ❌ Do NOT create summary files outside the main output

4. **File Structure**
   - Include all deliverables in the single output file
   - Use markdown headers to organize sections
   - Keep the structure defined in the command template

## Execution Pattern

```
Command: 01-competitive-insights.md
Input:   notes/transcripts/company-transcripts/*.md
Output:  analysis/transcript-analysis-2025-10-30/01-competitive-insights.md
```

## Before Starting

1. Check if output folder exists; create it if needed
2. Confirm you're writing to the correct single file
3. Process all transcripts in one pass
4. Write complete analysis to the single output file

## Quality Checks

- ✅ One markdown file created
- ✅ File contains all required sections from command template
- ✅ Evidence quotes include proper citations
- ✅ No additional files created
- ✅ Output folder matches pattern: `transcript-analysis-{date}`
