tldr: The user requested to apply several CSS style and React prop changes to a
  TextLink component. The agent identified the relevant files and changes,
  including adding a new variant="none" to the TextLink component, and is now
  ready to implement them.
overview: The user initiated a task to apply a series of visual design changes
  to a TextLink component within the codebase. These changes included modifying
  CSS properties like margin-top, margin-bottom, border-width, border-color, and
  background-color, as well as updating the variant prop from "underline" to
  "none". The agent successfully located the TextLink component definition and
  its specific usage in PostLink.tsx. A key decision made was to extend the
  TextLink component to support the new variant="none" before applying the prop
  change. The agent is now prepared to implement these identified changes.
