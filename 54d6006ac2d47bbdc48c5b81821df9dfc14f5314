tldr: The user requested dark mode and a theme toggle. The assistant implemented
  a class-based dark mode with CSS variables, an early theme-init script, and a
  fixed top-right toggle, updating various components to support the new theme.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  based on provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant adopted a class-based
  dark mode approach, leveraging CSS variables for  tokens and an early
  theme initialization script to prevent FOUC. A fixed top-right theme toggle
  was created and integrated into the layout. Key decisions involved updating
  Tailwind configuration, defining comprehensive light/dark CSS variables, and
  modifying components like  and  to correctly display
  colors and text in both themes. The assistant also considered and addressed
  potential UI conflicts, such as the toggle's placement relative to other
  buttons, and ensured proper color transitions. The outcome is a functional
  dark mode implementation with a user-controlled toggle.
