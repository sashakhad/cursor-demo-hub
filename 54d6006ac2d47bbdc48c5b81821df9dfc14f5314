tldr: The user requested dark mode and a theme toggle. The assistant implemented
  a class-based dark mode with CSS variables, an early theme initialization
  script, and a fixed top-right toggle, updating various components for theme
  compatibility.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, adhering to provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and the detailed plan. The core implementation involved configuring Tailwind
  CSS for class-based dark mode with CSS variables, defining light and dark
  theme variables in global CSS, and integrating an early theme initialization
  script in the main layout to prevent FOUC. A dedicated  component
  was created and positioned. Extensive modifications were made across various
  UI components to ensure they correctly adopted the new theme tokens for
  backgrounds, text, and borders, maintaining readability and visual consistency
  in both light and dark modes. A minor adjustment was made to the mobile
  sidebar's close button position to accommodate the new theme toggle.
