  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent is in the process of setting up the
  theme, updating Tailwind configuration, defining CSS variables, and adjusting
  component styling to support both light and dark modes.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, strictly following detailed product and plan documents. The
  agent's approach involves a comprehensive setup: first, understanding the
  existing styling architecture by reading relevant configuration files and
  component code. Then, it's proceeding with a class-based dark mode
  implementation, leveraging CSS variables for theme tokens, and integrating an
  early theme initialization script to prevent flashes of unstyled content. Key
  decisions include updating the Tailwind configuration to use CSS variables,
  defining light and dark mode variables in , and creating a
  dedicated  component. The agent is also meticulously adjusting
  existing component styles to ensure proper color transitions and readability
  across both themes, particularly addressing hardcoded colors and introducing
  new  and  tokens. The implementation is currently in
  progress, with the agent actively evaluating and modifying various components
  to align with the dark mode specifications."
