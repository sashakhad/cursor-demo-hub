tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle, following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent is in the process of setting up a
  class-based dark mode using CSS variables, updating Tailwind configuration,
  and creating a theme toggle component.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, strictly following the provided  and
   documents. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing these
  documents to understand the requirements, which include a class-based dark
  mode, CSS-variable-backed design tokens, an early theme initialization script
  to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC), and a fixed top-right toggle. The
  agent then proceeded to inspect the existing project structure and styling
  files, such as , , , and
  various components. It identified that current color definitions are hardcoded
  and need to be transitioned to CSS variables. The ongoing approach involves
  updating Tailwind to use CSS variables for  colors, defining
  comprehensive light and dark mode variable sets, and creating a
  component. Additionally, existing components will be modified to ensure proper
  theme application and readability across both light and dark modes.
