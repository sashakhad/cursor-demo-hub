tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle following a
  detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode with
  CSS variables, an early theme initialization script, and a theme toggle
  component, ensuring proper styling and functionality across various UI
  elements.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, guided by specific PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and then implementing a class-based dark mode using CSS variables. A crucial
  part of the implementation involved adding an early theme initialization
  script to prevent flashes of unstyled content (FOUC) and creating a dedicated
   component. The agent meticulously updated Tailwind configuration
  and various UI components to ensure they adapted correctly to both light and
  dark themes. During the process, the agent addressed potential conflicts in
  component positioning, particularly for the mobile sidebar, and refined the
  theme initialization to ensure a robust no-JavaScript fallback. After
  implementing the changes, the agent installed necessary dependencies, ran type
  checks and linting, and successfully verified the dark mode and theme toggle
  functionality in a development server.
