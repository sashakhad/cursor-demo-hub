tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The assistant successfully integrated a
  class-based dark mode using CSS variables, an early theme initialization
  script to prevent FOUC, and a functional theme toggle, updating various UI
  components for theme compatibility.
overview: "The user's intent was to integrate a dark mode and a theme toggle
  into the application, strictly following detailed product and plan
  specifications. The approach involved a comprehensive update of the styling
  system, transitioning from hardcoded colors to CSS variables managed by
  Tailwind's . Key decisions included implementing an early
  JavaScript theme initialization script in  to prevent flashes
  of unstyled content and creating a dedicated  component. The
  assistant also meticulously updated numerous UI components to ensure visual
  consistency across both light and dark themes, addressing specific elements
  like text colors, backgrounds, and borders. The outcome is a fully functional
  dark mode with a user-controlled toggle, adhering to the specified design and
  technical requirements."
