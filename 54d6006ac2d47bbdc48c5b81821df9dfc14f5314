tldr: The agent successfully implemented a dark mode theme and toggle, following
  a detailed plan. It involved updating Tailwind config, CSS variables, adding a
  theme initialization script, and creating a  component. Various
  UI components were adjusted to support both light and dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode theme and a
  theme toggle, guided by specific PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and the detailed plan. It then updated the Tailwind configuration to support
  class-based dark mode and CSS variables, defining comprehensive light and dark
  theme variables in the global CSS. A crucial part of the implementation was
  adding an early theme initialization script to prevent flashes of unstyled
  content (FOUC) and creating a dedicated  component. Throughout
  the process, numerous UI components were meticulously updated to ensure they
  correctly adopted the new theme tokens, maintaining visual consistency across
  both modes. The agent also addressed layout conflicts, such as repositioning
  the mobile sidebar's close button to accommodate the theme toggle. After
  implementing the changes, the agent ensured all dependencies were installed,
  ran type-checks and linting, and successfully started the development server
  to verify the new functionality.
