tldr: The user wanted to implement a dark mode and a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully updated the Tailwind
  configuration, CSS variables, and various components to support both light and
  dark themes, including an early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC.
overview: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and plan documents. The approach involved a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables for  tokens. The agent updated the Tailwind
  configuration, defined light and dark theme variables in global CSS, and added
  an early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC. A
  component was created and positioned in the top-right of the main content
  area, with careful consideration for mobile responsiveness and potential
  overlaps with existing UI elements. Various components were refactored to use
  the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling and readability across both
  light and dark modes. The solution also included a no-JS fallback using CSS
  media queries.
