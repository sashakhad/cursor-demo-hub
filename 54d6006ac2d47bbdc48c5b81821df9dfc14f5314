tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The assistant updated the Tailwind
  configuration, global CSS variables, and various components to support both
  light and dark themes, including an early theme initialization script to
  prevent FOUC.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, adhering to detailed PRD and plan documents. The assistant
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and then implementing a class-based dark mode using CSS variables. This
  involved modifying  and  to define
  comprehensive light and dark theme variables. An early theme initialization
  script was integrated into  to prevent flash of unstyled
  content (FOUC). A new  component was developed and strategically
  placed in the top-right of the main content panel. Throughout the process,
  various UI components were updated to ensure they correctly adopted the new
  theme tokens, with careful consideration given to color contrast, text
  visibility, and the toggle's positioning to avoid conflicts, especially on
  mobile devices. The conversation concluded with the application of patches to
   and  to establish the new theme system.
