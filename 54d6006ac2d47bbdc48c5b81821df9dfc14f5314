tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully updated the styling, created a theme
  toggle component, and adjusted various UI elements to support both light and
  dark themes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
overview: 'The user initiated a task to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, guided by specific product and plan documents. The agent began by
  thoroughly reviewing the existing styling setup and the provided
  specifications, which outlined a class-based dark mode, CSS-variable-backed
  tokens, an early theme initialization script, and a fixed top-right toggle.
  The implementation involved updating the Tailwind configuration to use CSS
  variables and , defining comprehensive light and dark theme
  variables in , and integrating an early theme initialization
  script in  to prevent flashes of unstyled content. A new
   component was created to manage theme switching and persistence.
  Numerous existing UI components, including , , and
  , were then adapted to utilize the new theme tokens, ensuring visual
  consistency across both modes. The agent also addressed potential layout
  conflicts by repositioning the mobile close button and refined the
   attribute handling for better SSR and no-JS fallback. After
  resolving a dependency installation issue, the agent started the development
  server to verify the end-to-end functionality of the dark mode and theme
  toggle.'
