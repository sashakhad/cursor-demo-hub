tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully implemented a
  class-based dark mode using Tailwind CSS and CSS variables, including an early
  theme initialization script and a dedicated toggle component, while updating
  various UI elements for consistent theming.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, adhering to detailed PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached this by first analyzing the existing styling setup
  and then implementing a class-based dark mode using Tailwind CSS and CSS
  variables. A crucial part of the implementation was adding an early theme
  initialization script to prevent any flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and
  creating a dedicated  component. Throughout the process, numerous
  UI components were updated to ensure they correctly adopted the new theme
  tokens, maintaining visual consistency across both light and dark modes. A key
  decision involved adjusting the mobile sidebar's close button position to
  prevent it from overlapping with the newly introduced theme toggle, ensuring a
  smooth user experience. The overall outcome was a fully functional dark mode
  with a theme toggle, integrated seamlessly into the application's design.
