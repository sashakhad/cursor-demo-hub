tldr: The user requested dark mode and a theme toggle. The assistant implemented
  a class-based dark mode with CSS variables, an early theme-init script, and a
  fixed top-right toggle, updating various components for theme compatibility.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, adhering to provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and the detailed plan. The core implementation involved configuring Tailwind
  CSS for class-based dark mode, defining light and dark theme CSS variables,
  and integrating an early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC. A
  dedicated  component was created and positioned. Throughout the
  process, numerous UI components like , , ,
  , , , and  were updated to utilize the new
  theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling and readability across both themes.
  Minor adjustments were made to button positioning to prevent overlaps. The
  outcome is a fully functional dark mode with a theme toggle, integrated
  seamlessly into the application's existing structure.
