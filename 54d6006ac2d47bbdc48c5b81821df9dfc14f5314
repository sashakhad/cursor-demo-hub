tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The assistant successfully implemented a
  class-based dark mode using CSS variables, added a theme toggle component, and
  updated various UI elements to support both light and dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement a dark mode and a theme toggle,
  guided by detailed product and plan documents. The assistant began by
  thoroughly reviewing the existing codebase and the provided specifications.
  The core approach involved a class-based dark mode, leveraging CSS variables
  for a flexible theming system. A critical part of the implementation was an
  early theme initialization script to prevent flashes of unstyled content
  (FOUC) and a dedicated  component. Throughout the process,
  numerous UI components were meticulously updated to ensure visual consistency
  and responsiveness across both light and dark themes. Key decisions included
  dynamically setting the theme via JavaScript and CSS media queries, adjusting
  component layouts to accommodate the new toggle, and refining color tokens for
  optimal contrast. The outcome is a fully functional dark mode with a
  user-friendly toggle, adhering to the specified design and technical
  requirements.
