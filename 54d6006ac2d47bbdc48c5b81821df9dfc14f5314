tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode theme toggle following a
  detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode with
  CSS variables, an early theme initialization script, and a functional theme
  toggle, verifying the changes in the browser.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement a dark mode theme toggle based
  on provided product and plan documents. The agent systematically updated the
  Tailwind configuration to support class-based dark mode with CSS variables. It
  then defined comprehensive light and dark theme variables in the global CSS
  and integrated an early theme initialization script into the main layout to
  prevent flashes of unstyled content. A new  component was created
  and placed in the top-right corner of the main content panel. Numerous
  existing components were modified to utilize the new theme tokens, ensuring
  consistent styling across both light and dark modes. The agent also addressed
  potential conflicts with existing UI elements and refined the theme
  initialization logic for better user experience and a robust no-JS fallback.
  After installing dependencies and running type checks, the agent launched a
  development server and successfully verified the dark mode toggle
  functionality in the browser.
