tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully implemented a
  class-based dark mode using Tailwind CSS variables, an early theme
  initialization script, and a theme toggle component, ensuring theme
  persistence and cross-component styling.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, guided by detailed PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached this by first understanding the existing styling
  setup and then implementing a class-based dark mode using Tailwind CSS and CSS
  variables. A crucial part of the implementation was an early theme
  initialization script to prevent any flash of unstyled content. A dedicated
   component was created and integrated into the layout. Throughout
  the process, numerous components were updated to ensure they correctly adopted
  the new theme tokens, maintaining visual consistency across the application.
  The agent also addressed mobile layout considerations for the toggle and
  sidebar. A key decision was to remove the initial
  attribute from the HTML to enable a graceful no-JavaScript fallback and
  prevent FOUC. Finally, the agent verified the implementation by interacting
  with the theme toggle in a browser and confirming theme persistence after a
  reload.
