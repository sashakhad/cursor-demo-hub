tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables, an early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC, and
  a persistent theme toggle, updating various components for theme
  compatibility.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, guided by comprehensive PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing codebase and
  the provided specifications. The core implementation involved configuring
  Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode, defining light and dark theme CSS
  variables in globals.css, and integrating an early theme initialization script
  in app/layout.tsx to prevent FOUC. A new ThemeToggle component was created,
  providing a persistent way for users to switch themes. Crucially, several
  existing components such as FilteredPosts, PostLink, and TextLink were updated
  to use the new theme tokens, ensuring visual consistency across both light and
  dark modes. The agent also considered potential UI conflicts, like the theme
  toggle's position relative to other elements, and ensured accessibility
  features were included in the toggle.
