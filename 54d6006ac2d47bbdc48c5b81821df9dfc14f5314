  toggle, updating various components to support both light and dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, adhering to specific PRD and plan documents. The assistant
  systematically approached this by first reviewing the existing styling setup
  and then implementing a class-based dark mode. This involved updating the
  Tailwind configuration to use CSS variables, defining comprehensive light and
  dark theme variables in the global CSS, and integrating an early theme
  initialization script in the main layout to prevent any flash of unstyled
  content. A dedicated  component was created and positioned.
  Throughout the process, various UI components such as ,
  , , , and  were modified to correctly apply
  the new theme tokens, ensuring visual consistency and readability in both
  light and dark modes. The assistant also considered potential conflicts with
  UI element positioning and ensured a no-JS fallback for theme application.
