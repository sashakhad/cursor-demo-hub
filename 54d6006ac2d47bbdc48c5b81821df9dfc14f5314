tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle following a
  PRD and plan. The agent investigated the existing styling, planned to switch
  to CSS variable-backed colors, and identified areas needing updates to support
  the new theme system.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, adhering to provided product and plan documents. The agent began
  by thoroughly reviewing these documents, which outlined a class-based dark
  mode approach, the use of CSS variable-backed  tokens, an early theme
  initialization script to prevent flashes of unstyled content, and a specific
  design for the theme toggle. The agent then proceeded to inspect the existing
  codebase, including Tailwind configuration and global CSS, to understand the
  current styling setup. Key findings included the prevalence of hardcoded
  colors and the need to transition to a more dynamic, CSS variable-driven color
  system. The agent planned to update Tailwind to use CSS variables, define
  comprehensive light and dark theme variables, and modify existing components
  to ensure proper theme integration and readability. The conversation reflects
  the initial planning and investigation phases of this implementation.
