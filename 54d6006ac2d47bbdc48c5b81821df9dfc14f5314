tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The assistant successfully integrated class-based dark mode,
  CSS variables, an early theme initialization script, and a theme toggle
  component, ensuring consistent styling across the application.
overview: The user initiated the implementation of a dark mode and a theme
  toggle for the application, guided by specific product and plan documents. The
  assistant systematically approached this by first understanding the existing
  styling setup and then introducing a class-based dark mode with CSS variables.
  A crucial part of the implementation was an early theme initialization script
  to prevent a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and a dedicated
  component. Key decisions involved carefully integrating the new theme tokens
  across various components, adjusting layout elements like the sidebar close
  button to prevent conflicts with the toggle, and refining the
  attribute on the HTML element to ensure a robust no-JavaScript fallback. The
  outcome is a fully functional dark mode with a user-controlled toggle,
  adhering to the specified design and technical requirements.
