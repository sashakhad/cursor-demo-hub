overview: The user requested the implementation of a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, adhering to specified PRD and plan documents. The agent proceeded by
  setting up a class-based dark mode with CSS variables, an early theme
  initialization script to prevent flashes of unstyled content, and a fixed
  top-right theme toggle. Key steps involved updating Tailwind configuration,
  global CSS, and the main layout, along with creating a dedicated
  component. Numerous existing UI components were modified to integrate the new
  theme tokens, ensuring visual consistency and readability across both light
  and dark modes. The solution included theme persistence via  and
  a graceful no-JS fallback using CSS media queries. During the process, the
  agent addressed a dependency installation issue and verified the functionality
  by running a development server and interacting with the theme toggle in a
  browser.
