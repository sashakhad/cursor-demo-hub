tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables, added an early theme initialization script, and
  integrated a theme toggle component. Various UI components were updated to
  support both light and dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, guided by specific PRD and plan documents. The agent adopted a
  class-based dark mode strategy, leveraging CSS variables for a flexible and
  maintainable color system. Key steps included updating the Tailwind
  configuration, defining comprehensive light and dark theme variables in global
  CSS, and integrating an early theme initialization script in the main layout
  to ensure a smooth user experience without flashes of unstyled content. A
  dedicated  component was developed for user interaction.
  Throughout the process, the agent meticulously updated various UI components,
  such as post listings, links, buttons, and input fields, to ensure they
  rendered correctly in both themes. Adjustments were also made to component
  positioning, like the sidebar's close button, to accommodate the new theme
  toggle. The agent also handled dependency installation to ensure a clean
  build.
