tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode and theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully implemented a
  class-based dark mode using CSS variables, an early theme initialization
  script, and a fixed theme toggle, updating core styling and layout files.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, strictly following provided PRD and plan documents. The agent began by
  reviewing these documents and existing styling configurations, including
  , , and layout components. The core
  approach involved a class-based dark mode, utilizing CSS variables for
  tokens, and an early theme initialization script to prevent Flash of Unstyled
  Content (FOUC). A fixed top-right theme toggle was designed, requiring careful
  placement adjustments to avoid conflicts with existing UI elements,
  particularly the sidebar's close button on mobile. The implementation involved
  updating Tailwind's configuration to use CSS variables, defining light and
  dark theme variables in global CSS, and integrating the theme toggle and
  initialization script into the main layout. The agent also identified and
  updated hardcoded colors in various components to ensure they adapted
  correctly to both light and dark themes.
