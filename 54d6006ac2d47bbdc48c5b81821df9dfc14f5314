overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, strictly following the provided product requirements and plan
  documents. The assistant adopted a class-based dark mode approach, leveraging
  CSS variables for  tokens to ensure consistent theming. A critical step

  prevent any flash of unstyled content (FOUC). A  component was
  created and positioned as a fixed element in the top-right corner. Throughout
  the process, the assistant updated  to use CSS variables,
  defined light and dark theme variables in , and modified
  various UI components such as , , , and
   to correctly apply the new theme tokens for backgrounds, text, and
  borders. Special attention was given to the theme toggle's placement to avoid
  conflicts with other UI elements, particularly on mobile. The implementation
  also included a no-JavaScript fallback using CSS media queries.
