overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle in a Next.js application, providing specific PRD and plan
  documents for guidance. The assistant began by thoroughly reviewing these
  documents to understand the requirements, which included a class-based dark
  mode, CSS variable-backed tokens, an early theme initialization script to
  prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content), and a fixed top-right toggle.
  Following this, the assistant inspected the project's existing styling and
  theme configuration files, such as , ,
  , and relevant components like , to
  identify areas for modification and ensure a smooth integration of the new
  theme. The next steps involve implementing the persisted theme toggle and
  verifying its functionality.
