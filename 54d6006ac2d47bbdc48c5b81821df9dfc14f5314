tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables, an early theme initialization script, and a functional
  theme toggle, ensuring a consistent user experience across light and dark
  themes.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate a dark mode and a theme toggle into
  the application, guided by specific product and plan documents. The agent
  adopted a class-based dark mode approach, leveraging CSS variables for theme
  tokens and an early JavaScript initialization script to mitigate flashes of
  unstyled content. Key decisions involved updating Tailwind configuration,
  defining comprehensive light and dark CSS variables, and creating a dedicated
   component. The agent meticulously patched various UI components
  to ensure they adapted correctly to both themes, including text colors,
  backgrounds, and borders. A notable modification was the removal of a default
   attribute from the HTML to enable a robust no-JavaScript
  fallback. The process concluded with successful dependency installation,
  type-checking, linting, and verification in a development server.
