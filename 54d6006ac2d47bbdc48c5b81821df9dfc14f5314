tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully implemented a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables, added a theme toggle, and updated various components to
  support both light and dark themes, ensuring a smooth user experience and a
  no-JS fallback.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature with a
  theme toggle, guided by comprehensive PRD and plan documents. The agent
  systematically approached the task by first analyzing the existing styling
  setup and then implementing a class-based dark mode. This involved updating
  the Tailwind configuration to utilize CSS variables, defining distinct light
  and dark theme variables in the global CSS, and integrating an early theme
  initialization script in the layout to prevent flashes of unstyled content. A
  dedicated  component was created, and numerous existing UI
  components were meticulously updated to ensure they rendered correctly and
  consistently across both themes. Key decisions included adjusting the mobile
  close button's position to accommodate the new theme toggle and removing the
  default  attribute from the HTML to improve the
  no-JavaScript fallback and prevent initial theme flashes. The outcome is a
  fully functional dark mode implementation that adheres to the specified
  requirements, providing a seamless theme-switching experience for users.
