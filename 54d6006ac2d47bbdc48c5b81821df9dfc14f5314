tldr: The agent successfully implemented a dark mode theme with a toggle,
  following a detailed plan. It involved updating CSS variables, Tailwind
  configuration, and various components to support both light and dark themes,
  ensuring a smooth user experience with a no-JS fallback.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode theme and a
  theme toggle, guided by specific PRD and plan documents. The agent adopted a
  class-based dark mode approach, leveraging Tailwind CSS and CSS variables for
  theme management. Key steps included defining light and dark theme variables
  in , updating  to use these variables, and
  integrating an early theme initialization script in  to prevent
  flashes of unstyled content. A dedicated  component was created,
  and numerous existing UI components were modified to ensure consistent styling
  across both themes. The agent also addressed potential layout conflicts,
  particularly with the theme toggle and mobile sidebar, and ensured a robust
  no-JavaScript fallback. After applying all necessary code changes, the agent
  installed dependencies, ran type-checks and linting, and started a development
  server to validate the implementation.
