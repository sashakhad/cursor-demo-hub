tldr: The conversation details the implementation of a dark mode theme and a
  toggle button. The agent followed a detailed plan, updating Tailwind, CSS
  variables, and various components to support both light and dark themes,
  ensuring a smooth user experience with a no-JS fallback.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate a dark mode theme and a theme
  toggle into the application, following specific product and plan documents.
  The agent adopted a systematic approach, starting with understanding the
  existing codebase and then implementing the theme layer by updating Tailwind
  configuration to use CSS variables and defining light/dark theme variables in
  . A key decision was to implement an early theme initialization
  script to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) and ensure a graceful no-JS
  fallback. The agent also created a dedicated  component and
  meticulously updated various UI components to use the new theme tokens,
  ensuring visual consistency across both light and dark modes. The final
  outcome was a fully functional dark mode with a theme toggle, adhering to the
  specified requirements.
