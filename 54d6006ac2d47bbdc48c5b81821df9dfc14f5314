tldr: The conversation details the implementation of a dark mode theme and a
  theme toggle in a Next.js application. The agent followed a detailed plan,
  updating styling, components, and layout to support both light and dark themes
  with proper token usage and FOUC prevention.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate a dark mode feature and a theme
  toggle into their Next.js application. The agent approached this by first
  thoroughly reviewing the provided PRD and plan documents, then inspecting the
  existing styling and component structure. Key decisions involved adopting a
  class-based dark mode with CSS variables for theme tokens, implementing an
  early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC, and creating a dedicated
  ThemeToggle component. The agent systematically updated tailwind.config.ts,
  app/globals.css, app/layout.tsx, and several UI components like FilteredPosts,
  PostLink, and SideBar to ensure consistent theming. A notable adjustment was
  repositioning the mobile sidebar's close button to accommodate the new theme
  toggle. The outcome is a fully functional dark mode with a user-controlled
  toggle, adhering to the specified design and technical requirements.
