tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The assistant successfully implemented a
  class-based dark mode using CSS variables, an early theme initialization
  script, and a fixed top-right theme toggle, updating various UI components to
  support the new theming.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The assistant adopted
  a class-based dark mode strategy, leveraging CSS variables for a token-based
  color system (dev-* tokens). A crucial part of the implementation involved
  adding an early theme initialization script in app/layout.tsx to prevent a
  flash of unstyled content (FOUC). A new ThemeToggle component was created and
  positioned fixed at the top-right. Throughout the process, various UI
  components such as tailwind.config.ts, globals.css, FilteredPosts, PostLink,
  TextLink, Button, Input, and Divider were systematically updated to ensure
  consistent theming across the application. The assistant also addressed
  potential layout conflicts, like the theme toggle overlapping with the
  sidebar's close button, and ensured text and background colors transitioned
  correctly between light and dark modes. The final outcome successfully
  integrated a functional and visually consistent dark mode.
