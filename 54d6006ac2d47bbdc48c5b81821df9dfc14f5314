tldr: The user requested to implement a dark mode with a theme toggle following
  a detailed plan. The agent successfully integrated a class-based dark mode
  using CSS variables, an early theme initialization script, and a fixed theme
  toggle, updating various components to support both light and dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode and a theme
  toggle, strictly following the provided product and plan documents. The agent
  began by thoroughly reviewing the existing styling setup and the detailed
  plan, which specified a class-based dark mode, CSS-variable-backed tokens, an
  early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC, and a fixed top-right
  toggle. The implementation involved updating the Tailwind configuration to use
  CSS variables, defining comprehensive light and dark theme variables in
  , and integrating a theme toggle component with client-side logic
  for persistence. Numerous UI components, including post listings, links,
  buttons, and input fields, were modified to dynamically adapt their styles
  based on the active theme. A key decision was to remove the initial
   attribute from the HTML to allow CSS media queries to
  handle the no-JS fallback gracefully. The mobile sidebar's close button was
  also repositioned to accommodate the new theme toggle. The outcome was a fully
  functional dark mode implementation that adheres to the specified design and
  technical requirements.
