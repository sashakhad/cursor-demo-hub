overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode theme and a
  theme toggle, guided by detailed PRD and plan documents. The agent began by
  thoroughly reviewing the existing codebase and the provided specifications. It
  then proceeded to implement a class-based dark mode, leveraging CSS variables
  for theme tokens and ensuring a smooth transition between light and dark
  modes. A key part of the implementation was the creation of a
  component and an early theme initialization script to prevent FOUC. The agent
  meticulously updated numerous UI components, including ,

  visual consistency. Throughout the process, the agent made thoughtful
  adjustments, such as repositioning the mobile close button to accommodate the
  theme toggle and refining the  attribute handling for a robust
  no-JS fallback. Finally, the agent ensured code quality by running type checks
  and linting after installing necessary dependencies.
