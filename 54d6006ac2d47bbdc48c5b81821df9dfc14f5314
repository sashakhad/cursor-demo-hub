tldr: The user requested dark mode and a theme toggle. The assistant implemented
  a class-based dark mode with CSS variables, an early theme initialization
  script, and a fixed top-right toggle, ensuring proper color transitions and
  layout adjustments.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  based on provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant adopted a class-based
  dark mode approach, leveraging CSS variables for  tokens and
  integrating them into the Tailwind configuration. A crucial part of the
  implementation involved adding an early theme initialization script in
   to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) and setting
   on the HTML element. A  component was created and
  positioned as a fixed element in the top-right corner. Throughout the process,
  the assistant meticulously updated  with light and dark theme
  variables, adjusted existing component styles (e.g., ,
  , ) to ensure proper color transitions and readability in
  both themes, and addressed potential layout conflicts for the toggle on
  mobile. The final implementation included a no-JS fallback using CSS media
  queries and careful consideration of color visibility for UI elements.
