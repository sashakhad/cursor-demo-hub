tldr: The user requested the implementation of a dark mode with a theme toggle,
  following specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully implemented
  a class-based dark mode using Tailwind CSS, including theme persistence, a
  toggle component, and updated various UI elements to support both light and
  dark themes.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle, guided by detailed PRD and plan documents. The agent proceeded
  by setting up a class-based dark mode with Tailwind CSS, defining
  comprehensive light and dark CSS variables in  and integrating
  them into . To ensure a smooth user experience, an early
  theme initialization script was embedded in  to manage theme
  persistence via  and eliminate flashes of unstyled content
  (FOUC). A dedicated  component was developed and
  strategically placed in the top-right corner of the main content panel.
  Throughout the process, numerous UI components, including ,
  , and , were meticulously updated to adopt the new theme
  tokens, guaranteeing visual consistency across both modes. The agent also
  addressed potential layout conflicts, such as adjusting the mobile sidebar's
  close button to accommodate the new toggle. A key decision involved removing
  the default  attribute from the  tag to enable a
  robust no-JS fallback using CSS media queries. After resolving a
  dependency issue, the agent launched a development server to thoroughly verify
  the implementation.
