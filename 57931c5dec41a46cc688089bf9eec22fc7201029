tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully implemented this by updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining
  CSS variables for light and dark themes, creating a dedicated theme toggle
  component, and integrating it into the application layout.
overview: "The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle feature, providing PRD and PLAN documents for guidance. The agent began
  by reviewing these documents and the existing codebase, including
  , , , and
  . The implementation involved several steps: first,
   was updated to enable dark mode and use CSS variables for
  colors. Next,  was modified to define specific CSS variables
  for both light and dark themes, including a new  token. A new
   component was created, incorporating client-side logic for
  theme switching, local storage persistence, and accessibility features. This
  toggle and a theme initialization script were then integrated into
  . Finally,  was updated to use the new
   token and adjust text colors for proper dark mode display.
  The process was systematic, ensuring all relevant parts of the application
  adapted to the new theming system."
