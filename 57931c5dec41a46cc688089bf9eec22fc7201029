tldr: I implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD and PLAN
  documents. The implementation involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration,
  global styles, creating a new theme toggle component, and adjusting existing
  components to be theme-aware. During testing, an unexpected existing theme
  selector was discovered, leading to a check of the git status.
overview: "The user's intent was to add dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application. The approach involved a systematic update of the
  application's styling and components. Key decisions included using Tailwind
  CSS's  and defining CSS variables for theme colors. A
   component was created, and a script was added to
  for theme initialization and persistence. Several components were modified to
  use the new theme tokens, ensuring they adapt to the selected theme. The
  outcome was a mostly implemented dark mode, but a discrepancy was found during
  testing where an existing, unplanned theme selector was present, prompting
  further investigation."
