tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  updated Tailwind CSS configuration, global styles, created a theme toggle
  component, and adjusted various components to support dark mode. During
  testing, a hydration mismatch error was encountered, and the issue was not
  fully resolved.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle into the application. The agent followed a structured plan, starting by
  updating the Tailwind CSS configuration to enable dark mode and defining CSS
  variables for both light and dark themes in . A
  component was created to manage theme switching, and a client-side script was
  added to  for initial theme detection and application. Several
  existing components were then refactored to utilize the new theme tokens,
  ensuring consistent styling across modes. During testing, an initial misstep
  involved running the application from the wrong directory, leading to
  confusion about existing theme implementations. After correcting the
  environment, a hydration mismatch error was identified, suggesting an issue
  with how the theme was being initialized or how the  component
  was rendering, which remained unresolved.
