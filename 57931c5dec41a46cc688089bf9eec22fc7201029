  successfully implemented this by updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining
  CSS variables for themes, creating a theme toggle component, and adjusting
  existing components to be theme-aware.
overview: "The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, providing PRD and PLAN documents for guidance. The agent began by
  thoroughly reviewing these documents and the existing codebase, including
  Tailwind configuration, global CSS, and key React components. The
  implementation involved several steps: enabling dark mode in
   to use CSS classes, defining comprehensive light and dark
  theme color variables in , and creating a dedicated
   component for user interaction. The  file

  integrate the new . Crucially, various existing components such
  as , , , and  were refactored to
  utilize the newly defined theme tokens and classes, ensuring a consistent look
  and feel across both light and dark modes. The agent systematically addressed
  hardcoded colors, replacing them with dynamic theme variables. The process
  concluded with all necessary code modifications for a functional dark mode
  implementation."
