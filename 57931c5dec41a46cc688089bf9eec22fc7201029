tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode with a theme toggle. The agent
  made significant code changes across multiple files to support dark mode,
  including updating Tailwind config, CSS variables, creating a toggle
  component, and adjusting component styles. The agent then debugged issues with
  the dev server and a hydration error.
overview: The user's intent was to add dark mode functionality with a theme
  toggle to the application. The agent approached this by first reviewing the
  provided PRD and PLAN documents, then analyzing the existing codebase. The
  implementation involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining CSS
  variables for light and dark themes, creating a dedicated
  component, and integrating it into the main layout. Several existing
  components were modified to utilize the new theme tokens for consistent
  styling. During testing, the agent identified that the development server was
  running from an incorrect location, which was rectified. Subsequently, a
  hydration mismatch error was encountered, which the agent was actively
  debugging to ensure the theme toggle functioned as expected.
