tldr: The user requested dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent successfully
  implemented it by updating Tailwind config, CSS variables, creating a toggle
  component, and modifying existing components. A key challenge was ensuring the
  correct development server was running, which was resolved by restarting it in
  the right worktree.

  The agent started by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then
  analyzed the existing codebase, including , ,
  , and several components to understand current color usage. The
  implementation involved enabling  in Tailwind, defining CSS
  variables for light and dark themes, creating a  React component,
  and integrating a theme initialization script into . Crucially,
  existing components like , , , and
  were updated to utilize the new theme tokens, replacing hardcoded colors.
  During testing, the agent encountered an issue where an incorrect development
  server was running, displaying an unexpected theme selector. This was resolved
  by identifying the correct worktree, installing dependencies, and restarting
  the dev server on a new port, successfully displaying the implemented dark
  mode toggle.'
