tldr: The user asked to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The assistant
  updated several files to support dark mode and created a theme toggle
  component. However, the theme toggle button was not visible in the browser,
  and the assistant discovered the dev server was initially running from the
  wrong directory.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the
  application. The assistant followed the provided PRD and PLAN documents,
  making extensive changes to tailwind.config.ts, app/globals.css,
  app/layout.tsx, and creating a new ThemeToggle.tsx component. Several existing
  components like FilteredPosts, TextLink, PostLink, and Button were updated to
  use the new CSS variables for colors, ensuring proper theming. A significant
  hurdle was encountered when the dev server was found to be running from an
  incorrect directory, leading to confusion about an existing theme selector.
  After correcting the server's working directory and reinstalling dependencies,
  the theme toggle button was still not visible in the browser, indicating a
  potential rendering issue that the assistant was investigating.
