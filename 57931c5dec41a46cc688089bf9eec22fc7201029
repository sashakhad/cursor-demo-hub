tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by
  modifying Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, and several React
  components. Upon testing, it discovered an existing, different theme selector,
  indicating a potential conflict.
overview: The user's intent was to implement a dark mode feature with a theme
  toggle. The agent approached this by first reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN
  documents, then analyzing the existing codebase. It systematically updated
   to enable dark mode, defined light and dark mode CSS
  variables in , and created a  component. The
  agent then integrated the  and a theme initialization script into
  . Several components, including , ,
  , and , were modified to use the new theme tokens and ensure
  proper color rendering in both light and dark modes. Upon testing the
  implemented feature, the agent discovered a pre-existing theme selector with
  multiple themes, which was not part of the current task, indicating a
  potential discrepancy or a need to reconcile with an existing theme system.
