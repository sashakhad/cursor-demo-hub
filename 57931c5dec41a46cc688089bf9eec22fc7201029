tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle in the application. This involved configuring Tailwind CSS, defining
  CSS variables for themes, creating a dedicated theme toggle component, and
  updating existing components to use the new theme-aware color tokens.
overview: "The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the
  application, guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent approached
  this by first reviewing the provided documents and the existing codebase. The
  implementation involved several key steps: configuring Tailwind CSS for dark
  mode, defining distinct color variables for light and dark themes in
  globals.css, and creating a ThemeToggle React component. The layout.tsx file
  was updated to include a client-side script for theme initialization and to
  render the ThemeToggle. Finally, existing components like FilteredPosts.tsx
  and TextLink.tsx were refactored to utilize the new theme-aware CSS variables,
  ensuring proper color rendering in both light and dark modes."
