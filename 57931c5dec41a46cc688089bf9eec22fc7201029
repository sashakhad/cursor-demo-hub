tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully implemented this by updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining
  CSS variables for themes, creating a new ThemeToggle component, and modifying
  existing components to use the new theme-aware color tokens.
overview: "The user wanted to implement a dark mode feature with a theme toggle.
  The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand
  the requirements. The implementation involved several steps: first,
   was updated to enable class-based dark mode and use CSS
  variables for colors. Next,  was modified to define specific
  CSS variables for both light and dark themes, including a new
  token. A new  component was created to handle theme switching
  and persist the user's preference in local storage. The  file
  was then updated to include a theme initialization script for a flicker-free
  experience and to integrate the new  component. Finally, existing
  components such as , , and
  were refactored to utilize the new theme-aware color tokens, replacing
  hardcoded colors like  with dynamic CSS variables or Tailwind
  classes that respond to the active theme. This comprehensive approach
  successfully integrated dark mode functionality into the application."
