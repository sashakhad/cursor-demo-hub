tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. It also debugged an issue where the dev
  server was running from the wrong directory, causing an incorrect theme
  selector to appear, and then restarted the server in the correct worktree.
overview: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle,
  referencing specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase to understand the
  requirements and current state. It then proceeded to implement dark mode by
  updating  to enable dark mode and use CSS variables, and
   to define light and dark theme color variables. A new
   component was created for switching themes, and
   was updated to include a theme initialization script and the
  . The agent also refactored several components, including
  , , , and , to utilize the new
  theme-aware color tokens. During the testing phase, the agent identified that
  the development server was running from an incorrect directory, leading to an
  outdated theme selector being displayed. It resolved this by installing
  dependencies and restarting the dev server within the correct worktree,
  allowing for proper verification of the dark mode implementation.
