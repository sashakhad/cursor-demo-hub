tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully implemented this feature by updating CSS variables, creating a
  theme toggle component, and adjusting existing components to use the new theme
  tokens. Initial testing issues due to an incorrect dev server and a hydration
  error were resolved.

  The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then
  analyzed the existing codebase, including ,
  , , and .
  The implementation involved updating  to enable dark mode
  and use CSS variables, modifying  with light/dark CSS
  variables, creating a  component, and updating
   with a theme initialization script. Several components were
  adjusted to use the new theme tokens, replacing hardcoded colors with dynamic
  ones. During testing, the agent discovered the dev server was running from an
  incorrect directory, which was rectified by restarting the server in the
  correct worktree after installing dependencies. A hydration mismatch error was
  also encountered, which was resolved by refreshing the browser. The dark mode
  toggle functionality was successfully verified after these issues were
