tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by updating Tailwind
  CSS configuration, global styles, creating a new ThemeToggle component, and
  modifying several existing components to use theme tokens. A key challenge was
  ensuring the development server was running from the correct worktree to see
  the changes.
overview: "The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, providing PRD and PLAN documents for guidance. The agent began by
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase. The implementation
  involved several steps: enabling dark mode in  and
  converting color definitions to CSS variables, defining light and dark mode
  color variables in , creating a  component
  for user interaction, and integrating a theme initialization script into
  . Additionally, several components like ,
  , , and  were updated to use the new
  theme tokens and ensure proper color rendering in both modes. During testing,
  the agent encountered an issue where an incorrect dev server was running,
  displaying an unintended theme selector. This was debugged and resolved by
  ensuring the dev server was started from the correct worktree after installing
  necessary dependencies."
