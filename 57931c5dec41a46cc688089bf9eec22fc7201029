tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by updating various
  configuration and component files. A key challenge was ensuring the
  development server was running from the correct worktree, which required
  installing dependencies and restarting the server.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  adhering to specified PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by reviewing
  these documents and the existing codebase. It then systematically updated
   to enable dark mode, defined light and dark CSS variables
  in , and created a  component. The
   file was modified to include a theme initialization script
  and the new  component. Several components, including
  , , , and , were
  updated to use the new theme tokens and ensure proper color rendering in both
  light and dark modes. During testing, the agent discovered an incorrect theme
  selector in the browser, which was traced back to the development server
  running from the wrong worktree. The agent is currently installing
  dependencies in the correct worktree to resolve this and proceed with testing.
