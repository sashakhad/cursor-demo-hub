tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD

  files. The process was complicated by the dev server running from the wrong
  directory, and then by the theme toggle not appearing in the browser.
overview: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle,
  adhering to specified PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by reading these
  documents and then analyzing the existing codebase. It systematically updated
   and  to support dark mode with CSS
  variables. A new  component was created, and
  was modified to include the theme initialization script and the toggle.
  Several components, including , ,
  , and , were adjusted to utilize the new theme
  tokens. A significant hurdle was encountered when the dev server was found to

  correcting the server's working directory and reinstalling dependencies, the
  theme toggle button was still not visible in the browser, indicating a new
  issue that required further debugging.
