tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD
  and PLAN documents. It updated several files including Tailwind config, global
  CSS, layout, and various components to support theming. During testing, an
  unexpected existing theme selector was discovered, indicating a potential
  discrepancy.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the
  application, guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent
  systematically updated the Tailwind CSS configuration, global stylesheets, and
  the main layout to support theme switching. It also refactored several UI
  components like FilteredPosts, TextLink, PostLink, and Button to utilize the
  new theme tokens, ensuring proper color rendering in both light and dark
  modes. However, upon testing the implemented features, an unexpected
  pre-existing theme selector was found in the application, suggesting a
  potential conflict or an unaddressed prior implementation.
