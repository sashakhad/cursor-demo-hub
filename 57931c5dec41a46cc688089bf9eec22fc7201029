tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD
  and PLAN documents. After making several code changes, the agent encountered
  and began debugging a hydration mismatch error preventing the theme toggle
  from rendering correctly.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the
  application. The agent started by reviewing the requirements and existing
  codebase. It then proceeded to implement the changes by updating Tailwind CSS
  configuration, defining CSS variables for light and dark themes, creating a
  ThemeToggle component, and integrating it into the main layout. Several
  components were also updated to use the new theme tokens. During testing, the
  agent discovered the dev server was running from an incorrect location, which
  was rectified. However, a hydration mismatch error prevented the theme toggle
  from appearing, and the agent was in the process of debugging this issue.
