tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The assistant successfully implemented this
  by modifying Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, creating a new
  theme toggle component, and updating layout and post filtering components to
  support dark mode.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  for the application, referencing specific PRD and PLAN documents. The
  assistant began by reviewing these documents and the existing codebase to
  understand the requirements and current state. The approach involved a
  multi-step process: first,  was updated to enable
  class-based dark mode and use CSS variables for colors. Next,
   was modified to define distinct CSS variables for both light
  and dark themes, including a new  token. A new
  component was then created to handle the theme switching logic, including
  local storage persistence and accessibility features. This toggle and a theme
  initialization script were integrated into . Finally,
   was updated to use the new  token and
  adjust text colors for dark mode compatibility. The outcome is a fully
  functional dark mode with a user-controlled theme toggle, adhering to the
  specified design documents."
