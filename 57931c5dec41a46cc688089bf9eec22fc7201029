tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. However, an existing, unexpected theme
  selector was discovered in the running application during testing.
overview: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle,
  guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent proceeded by first
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase. The implementation
  involved configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode, defining CSS variables for
  light and dark themes in , creating a  React
  component, and integrating a theme initialization script into .
  Several existing components, including , ,
  , and , were updated to utilize the new theme tokens for
  consistent styling. Upon testing the running application, the agent
  unexpectedly found an existing theme selector with multiple themes (Light,
  Dark, Purple, Orange), which was not part of the planned implementation.
