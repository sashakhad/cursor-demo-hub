tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by
  updating Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, creating a new
  ThemeToggle component, and adjusting color usage across several React
  components. A minor hiccup occurred when the dev server was found to be
  running from an incorrect directory, which was resolved by restarting it in
  the correct worktree.

  utilize the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling across the
  application. During testing, the agent encountered an unexpected theme
  selector in the browser. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the
  development server was running from an incorrect directory. The agent resolved
  this by installing dependencies and restarting the dev server within the
  correct worktree, allowing for proper verification of the dark mode
  implementation."
