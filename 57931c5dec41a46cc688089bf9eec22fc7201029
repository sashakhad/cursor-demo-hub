tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  updated Tailwind CSS, global styles, created a ThemeToggle component, and
  modified existing components to support dark mode. The agent also debugged
  server and hydration issues, but the theme toggle functionality was still not
  working correctly at the end of the conversation.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  based on specified PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase, including
  tailwind.config.ts, app/globals.css, app/layout.tsx, and FilteredPosts.tsx.
  The implementation involved enabling darkMode: \class\ in Tailwind, defining
  light and dark theme CSS variables in globals.css, and creating a ThemeToggle
  React component. An inline script was added to layout.tsx for theme
  initialization, and suppressHydrationWarning was used. Several components like
  FilteredPosts, TextLink, PostLink, and Button were updated to utilize the new
  CSS variables and Tailwind's dark: variants for proper theming. During
  testing, the agent encountered issues with the dev server running from an
  incorrect directory, which was resolved by restarting the server in the
  correct worktree after installing dependencies. A hydration mismatch error was
  also observed and addressed by refreshing the browser. Although the theme
  toggle button appeared, its functionality to switch between light and dark
  modes was not working correctly by the end of the conversation."
