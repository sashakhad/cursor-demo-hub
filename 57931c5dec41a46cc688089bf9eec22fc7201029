tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature.
  It updated Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, created a new
  theme toggle component, and integrated it into the application layout,
  ensuring proper color usage across components.
overview: "The user requested the implementation of a dark mode feature with a
  theme toggle, adhering to specified PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by
  reviewing these documents and the relevant parts of the codebase, including
  Tailwind CSS configuration, global styles, the main layout, and a specific
  component (). The approach involved a series of structured
  steps: enabling dark mode in Tailwind, defining light and dark color variables
  in global CSS, creating a dedicated  React component, integrating
  a theme initialization script and the toggle into the root layout, and
  finally, adjusting component-specific styles to utilize the new color tokens
  for dark mode compatibility. The outcome is a fully functional dark mode with
  a user-controlled toggle."
