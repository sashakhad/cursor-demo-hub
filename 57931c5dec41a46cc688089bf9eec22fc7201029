tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD
  and PLAN documents. However, upon testing, an existing theme selector was
  discovered, indicating a potential discrepancy with the initial requirements.
overview: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle.
  The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then
  analyzed the existing codebase. The implementation involved updating
   and  to define dark mode styles and CSS
  variables. A new  component was created, and
  was modified to include a theme initialization script and the toggle
  component. Several other components, including ,
  , , and , were updated to utilize the
  new theme tokens and ensure proper color rendering in both light and dark
  modes. During the final testing phase, the agent discovered an existing theme
  selector in the application that offered multiple themes (Light, Dark, Purple,
  Orange), which was different from the single dark mode toggle that was
  implemented. This suggests a potential conflict with existing features or a
  misunderstanding of the initial requirements.
