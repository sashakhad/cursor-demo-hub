tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully implemented the changes across several files, but encountered an
  issue where the dev server was running from the wrong directory, leading to an
  unexpected theme selector. The agent is now installing dependencies in the
  correct worktree to resolve this.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle in
  the application, adhering to specified PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began
  by thoroughly reviewing these documents and the existing codebase, including
  , , , and
  . The implementation involved updating
  to enable dark mode and use CSS variables, defining light and dark mode CSS
  variables in , creating a  component for
  user interaction, and integrating it into  along with a theme
  initialization script. Several components, including ,
  , , and , were modified to utilize the
  new theme tokens and ensure proper color rendering in both modes. During
  testing, the agent discovered an unexpected theme selector in the browser,
  which was traced back to the dev server running from an incorrect directory.
  The agent then took steps to rectify this by starting the dev server in the
  correct worktree and is currently installing necessary dependencies to proceed
  with testing the dark mode functionality.
