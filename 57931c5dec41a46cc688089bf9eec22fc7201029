tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode with a theme toggle. The agent
  updated several files, created a new theme toggle component, and adjusted
  color tokens across the application. However, the theme toggle button was not
  visible in the browser at the end of the conversation, indicating further
  debugging is needed.
overview: The user's intent was to add dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application. The agent followed the provided PRD and PLAN
  documents, starting by configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode and defining CSS
  variables for light and dark themes in . A
  component was created, and the main  was updated to include it and
  a client-side script for theme initialization. The agent then systematically
  updated various components like , , , and
   to use the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling. A key
  challenge encountered was the dev server running from an incorrect directory,
  which led to an older version of the app being displayed. This was rectified
  by restarting the server in the correct worktree after installing
  dependencies. However, at the end of the conversation, the theme toggle button
  was still not visible in the browser, indicating that the implementation was
  not fully verified or functional from the user's perspective and further
  investigation is needed.
