tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and added a theme toggle to the
  application. While the visual changes for dark mode were applied, the theme
  toggle functionality encountered issues and is currently being debugged.
overview: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle,
  guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent proceeded by updating
   to enable dark mode and use CSS variables, and
   with light and dark mode color definitions. A
  component was created, and  was updated to include the theme
  initialization script and the toggle component. Several existing components
  like , , , and  were modified to
  use the new theme tokens. During testing, the agent discovered the dev server
  was running from an incorrect directory, requiring dependency installation and
  a server restart in the correct worktree. Although the dark mode styles were
  applied, the theme toggle button was not functioning as expected, and a
  hydration mismatch error was observed. The agent is currently investigating
  the  component to resolve the issue.
