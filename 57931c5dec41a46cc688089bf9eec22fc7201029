tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode with a theme toggle. The agent
  made the necessary code changes, but encountered a hydration mismatch error
  during testing, which is currently being debugged.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate dark mode and a theme toggle into
  the application. The agent approached this by first reviewing the provided PRD
  and PLAN documents, then analyzing the existing codebase's color usage. Key
  changes included configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode, defining light and
  dark color variables in , creating a  component, and
  integrating a theme initialization script into . Several
  components were updated to use the new color tokens. During testing, the agent
  discovered the dev server was running from an incorrect directory, which was
  resolved by restarting the server in the correct worktree. However, a
  hydration mismatch error was encountered, preventing the theme toggle from
  rendering correctly, and the agent is currently investigating this issue.
