tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode with a theme toggle in the
  application. This involved updating CSS, Tailwind config, creating a new
  component, and modifying existing components to use theme tokens. The agent
  also debugged server and hydration issues to get it working.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the application
  based on provided design documents. The agent started by reading the
  requirements and then systematically updated the  and
   files to define light and dark mode color variables. A new
   component was created, and the main  was updated to
  include this toggle and a client-side script for theme initialization. The
  agent also refactored several existing components like ,
  , , and  to use the new theme tokens, ensuring a
  consistent look across both modes. During testing, the agent identified and
  corrected issues with the dev server running from an incorrect directory and
  resolved a hydration mismatch error, ultimately successfully implementing and
  verifying the dark mode functionality.
