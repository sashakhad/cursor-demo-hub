tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by modifying Tailwind
  CSS configuration, global styles, and several React components. During
  testing, the agent encountered issues with the theme toggle functionality and
  is currently debugging a hydration mismatch error and the toggle's inability
  to switch themes.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle.
  The agent began by reviewing the project's PRD and PLAN documents, then
  proceeded to modify the Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, and
  several React components to support dark mode. A new  component
  was created and integrated into the main layout. During the testing phase, the
  agent discovered that the development server was running from an incorrect
  directory, which was rectified. Subsequently, a hydration mismatch error was
  identified, and the theme toggle functionality was found to be
  non-operational, preventing the theme from switching correctly. The agent is
  currently investigating these issues to resolve the theme toggle's behavior.
