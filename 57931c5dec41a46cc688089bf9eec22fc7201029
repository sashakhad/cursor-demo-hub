tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle. This involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining light and
  dark mode CSS variables, creating a new ThemeToggle component, and adjusting
  color usage across several existing components to support both themes.
overview: The user's intent was to introduce dark mode and a theme toggle
  feature into the application. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the
  provided PRD and PLAN documents, along with existing codebase files like
  tailwind.config.ts, app/globals.css, app/layout.tsx, and FilteredPosts.tsx.
  The approach involved a structured implementation, starting with enabling dark
  mode in Tailwind CSS and defining comprehensive light and dark color
  variables. A dedicated ThemeToggle component was created for user interaction,
  and a client-side script was added to layout.tsx for theme initialization and
  persistence. Key decisions included using CSS variables for colors and
  systematically updating various components (FilteredPosts, TextLink, PostLink,
  Button) to utilize these new theme tokens, replacing hardcoded colors to
  ensure a consistent dark mode experience. The outcome is a fully functional
  dark mode with a user-friendly toggle.
