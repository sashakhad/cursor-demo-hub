tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle by
  updating Tailwind CSS configuration, global CSS variables, creating a
  ThemeToggle component, and adjusting color usage across several React
  components. An issue with an unexpected theme selector was resolved by
  restarting the dev server in the correct worktree.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  providing PRD and PLAN documents for guidance. The agent began by reviewing
  these documents and the existing codebase. The implementation involved several
  steps: configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode, defining light and dark theme
  CSS variables in globals.css, creating a ThemeToggle React component, and
  integrating a theme initialization script and the ThemeToggle into layout.tsx.
  Additionally, the agent systematically updated various components like
  FilteredPosts, TextLink, PostLink, and Button to utilize the newly defined
  theme tokens, replacing hardcoded colors. During the testing phase, an
  unexpected theme selector was observed in the browser. The agent diagnosed
  this as a problem with the dev server running from an incorrect directory and
  resolved it by restarting the server in the correct worktree. The overall
  outcome was a successful implementation of dark mode with a functional theme
  toggle, adhering to the provided specifications."
