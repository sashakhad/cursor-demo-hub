tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature.
  It involved updating CSS, Tailwind config, creating a new component, and
  fixing color usages across several existing components. The agent also
  debugged server and hydration issues to ensure proper functionality.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle.
  The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then
  analyzed the existing codebase. Key steps included configuring Tailwind CSS
  for dark mode, defining CSS variables for light and dark themes in
  , and developing a  React component. This toggle was
  integrated into the main layout, along with a client-side script for initial
  theme detection. The agent systematically updated several components to
  utilize the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling. During testing, the
  agent encountered and resolved issues related to the development server
  running from an incorrect directory and a hydration mismatch, ultimately
  verifying the successful implementation and functionality of the dark mode
  toggle.
