tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode with a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully implemented the dark mode functionality by updating configuration
  files, creating a theme toggle component, and adjusting existing components to
  use theme tokens. However, upon testing, an existing multi-theme selector was
  discovered, which was different from the intended simple dark mode toggle.
overview: The user wanted to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent started by reading these documents
  and then analyzed the existing codebase, including ,
  , , and . The
  implementation involved enabling dark mode in Tailwind, defining CSS variables
  for light and dark themes, creating a  component, and adding a
  theme initialization script to the  file. The agent also updated
  several components to use the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling
  across the application. Upon testing the implemented features, the agent
  discovered that the application already had a more comprehensive theme
  selector with multiple themes (Light, Dark, Purple, Orange), which was
  unexpected and differed from the simple dark mode toggle that was implemented.
