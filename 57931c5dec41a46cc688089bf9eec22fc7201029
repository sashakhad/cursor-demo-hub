tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent successfully implemented the
  changes across several files, including updating Tailwind CSS configuration,
  global styles, creating a theme toggle component, and adjusting color tokens
  in various components. However, during testing, an unexpected existing theme
  selector was found, leading to a check of the git status.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  adhering to specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase. The implementation
  involved several key steps: configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode, defining
  light and dark theme variables in global CSS, developing a dedicated
   component, and integrating a theme initialization script into
  the main layout. Additionally, the agent meticulously updated various
  components like , , , and  to
  utilize the new theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling across the
  application. Upon attempting to verify the implementation, the agent
  encountered an unexpected pre-existing theme selector in the running
  application, which was not part of the current task. This led to a usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects
