tldr: The agent implemented dark mode and a theme toggle based on provided PRD
  and PLAN documents. It involved updating Tailwind CSS, global styles, creating
  a new toggle component, and adjusting existing components to use theme tokens.
  However, an existing multi-theme selector was discovered after implementation.
overview: The user requested the implementation of a dark mode feature with a
  theme toggle, adhering to specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by
  reviewing these documents and the existing codebase, including
  , , , and
  . The implementation involved configuring Tailwind CSS for
  dark mode using the "class" strategy and defining CSS variables for light and
  dark themes in . A new  component was
  created to manage theme switching and persist the user's preference in local
  storage. This toggle and a theme initialization script were integrated into
  . Subsequently, several existing components, such as
  , , , and , were
  updated to utilize the newly defined theme tokens, ensuring consistent styling
  across both modes. Upon testing the application, the agent discovered an
  existing, more comprehensive theme selector with multiple themes (Light, Dark,
  Purple, Orange), which was not part of the initial implementation plan.
