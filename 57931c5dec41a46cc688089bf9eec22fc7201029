tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully updated configuration files, created a theme toggle component,
  and adjusted existing components to support dark mode. However, the theme
  toggle functionality was not working correctly by the end of the conversation,
  and the agent was still debugging it.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode and a theme toggle to the
  application. The agent followed the provided PRD and PLAN documents, starting
  by configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode and defining CSS variables for light
  and dark themes. A new ThemeToggle component was created and integrated into
  the main layout. The agent then systematically updated various existing
  components to use the new theme tokens, ensuring they adapt to the selected
  theme. During the process, the agent encountered and resolved issues related
  to the dev server running from the wrong directory and a hydration mismatch
  error. Although the dark mode implementation and toggle button were
  successfully added, the actual theme switching functionality was not working
  by the end of the conversation, requiring further debugging of the ThemeToggle
  component.
