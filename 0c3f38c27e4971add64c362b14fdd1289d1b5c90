tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented these themes by updating the CSS to use data-theme attributes,
  integrating a ThemeSelector component, and deleting the old ThemeToggle. A key
  decision involved resolving conflicting color specifications between the PRD
  and the plan documents.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The approach involved first
  reviewing the provided MULTI_THEME_PRD and MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents to
  understand the requirements and implementation strategy. A key challenge arose
  from conflicting color specifications between these two documents,
  particularly regarding whether the new themes should have distinct backgrounds
  and text colors or share them with the light theme. After careful
  consideration, the decision was made to adhere to the specific color values
  outlined in the MULTI_THEME_PRD, which specified that purple and orange themes
  would primarily differ in their accent colors while retaining the light
  theme's text and background. The implementation involved refactoring
  globals.css to use data-theme attributes, updating layout.tsx to integrate the
  ThemeSelector component, and removing the deprecated ThemeToggle. The outcome
  is a theme system that now supports light, dark, purple, and orange options,
  with the new themes reflecting the PRD's color definitions.
