tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The agent updated the CSS with the new themes, replaced the theme toggle with
  a selector, and removed the old component. There were some difficulties
  applying the CSS changes.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the existing theme system, referencing both a Product Requirements
  Document (PRD) and an implementation plan. The agent began by analyzing the
  current theme implementation and the provided documentation. A key challenge
  arose from conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the plan for
  the new themes. While the plan suggested a "complete color experience" for
  each new theme, the PRD specified that purple and orange themes should largely
  share text and background colors with the light theme, only differing in
  accent. The agent ultimately prioritized the PRD's explicit values. The
  implementation involved updating  to use  attributes
  for light, dark, purple, and orange, modifying  to use a
   component, and deleting the deprecated . The
  agent encountered persistent issues with the  tool failing to
  apply the  changes, which was an ongoing problem at the end of
  the conversation.
