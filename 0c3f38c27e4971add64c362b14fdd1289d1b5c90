tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the theme
  system. The assistant attempted to implement these themes by updating CSS,
  replacing a component, and modifying theme initialization. A key decision
  involved resolving conflicting color specifications between two design
  documents, ultimately prioritizing the PRD. However, the CSS updates
  repeatedly failed to apply.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the existing theme system, guided by MULTI_THEME_PRD and
  MULTI_THEME_PLAN. The assistant began by analyzing these documents and the
  current codebase, identifying the need to update globals.css with new theme
  definitions, modify layout.tsx to use a ThemeSelector component, and remove
  the old ThemeToggle. A significant challenge arose from conflicting color
  specifications between the PRD and the PLAN; the PRD outlined purple and
  orange themes that largely mirrored the light theme's text and background,
  while the PLAN proposed distinct, "complete" color experiences. After
  deliberation, the assistant prioritized the PRD's values as the requirements
  document. While layout.tsx and the deletion of ThemeToggle.tsx were
  successfully handled, the globals.css file repeatedly failed to update with
  the new data-theme attributes and theme definitions, leaving the CSS changes
  incomplete.
