tldr: The agent successfully added orange and purple theme options to the theme
  system. This involved updating the CSS with new theme definitions, replacing
  the ThemeToggle component with ThemeSelector, and adjusting the theme
  initialization script.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system with orange and purple
  options. The agent started by reviewing the provided PRD and plan documents,
  which outlined the necessary changes to CSS, layout, and components. A key
  challenge arose from conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the
  plan. While the plan suggested distinct color palettes for each new theme, the
  PRD specified that purple and orange themes should share text and background
  colors with the light theme, only changing the accent. The agent ultimately
  prioritized the PRD's explicit values, implementing the new themes with shared
  text/background and unique accent colors. The process also involved
  troubleshooting issues with file modification tools, eventually resorting to
  direct file overwrites and terminal commands for verification. The
   component was replaced with , and
  was updated to use  attributes.
