tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent reviewed design documents, identified necessary code
  changes, and prioritized a more comprehensive color palette from the plan
  document to ensure a cohesive theme design.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the application's theme system. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing
  the provided product requirements and planning documents to grasp the scope
  and specific color specifications. During this review, a discrepancy in color
  values was noted between the two documents. The agent made a key decision to
  prioritize the more detailed and cohesive color palette outlined in the
  planning document, ensuring a visually consistent theme experience. The
  implementation plan involves updating globals.css with the new themes,
  replacing ThemeToggle with ThemeSelector in layout.tsx, and deleting the old
  ThemeToggle component. The agent has started by preparing to update
  globals.css.
