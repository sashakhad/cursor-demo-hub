tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented this by updating CSS to use data-theme attributes,
  adding the new themes with specific color values from the PRD, and refactoring
  the theme selection component.
overview: The user wanted to introduce orange and purple theme options. The
  assistant began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, which
  outlined the requirements and implementation strategy. A key challenge arose
  from conflicting color specifications between these two documents for the new
  themes. While the PLAN suggested distinct color systems for purple and orange,
  the PRD specified that these themes should share text and background colors
  with the light theme, only changing the accent. Despite the PRD's internal
  contradiction about "complete color systems," the assistant prioritized the
  PRD as the requirements document. The implementation involved updating
   to use  attributes, adding the purple and orange
  themes with the PRD's specified colors, updating  to integrate the
   component, and removing the old  component.
