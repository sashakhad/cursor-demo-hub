tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. The assistant implemented these themes by updating the CSS to use
  data-theme attributes, adding the new theme definitions, replacing the old
  theme toggle with a new selector, and deleting the old component. A key
  challenge was resolving conflicting color specifications between the PRD and
  the plan.

  to follow the PRD's explicit color values. The implementation involved
  updating  to use  attributes for all themes,
  modifying  to use , and deleting the old
   component. The process was complicated by repeated issues where
