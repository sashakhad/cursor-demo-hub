tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. The assistant implemented these themes, updated the theme
  selection mechanism, and resolved a conflict in color specifications by
  prioritizing the PRD's explicit values.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The approach involved updating
  the CSS to define these new themes using  attributes, replacing
  the old  component with , and adjusting the theme
  initialization logic. A key challenge was reconciling conflicting color
  specifications between the provided PRD and implementation plan documents. The
  assistant ultimately decided to adhere to the explicit color values detailed
  in the PRD for the purple and orange themes, which meant these themes shared
  text and background colors with the light theme, only differing in their
  accent color. This decision was made despite the PRD also stating that themes
  should be "complete color systems," which seemed to contradict its own
  specific values. The outcome is a theme system with light, dark, purple, and
  orange options, with the latter two implemented according to the PRD's
  specific color definitions.
