tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the theme
  system. The assistant implemented this by updating the CSS with the new
  themes, switching to a ThemeSelector component, and adjusting the theme
  initialization script. A key decision involved resolving conflicting color
  specifications between the PRD and the plan documents.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The assistant began by thoroughly
  reviewing the provided MULTI_THEME_PRD and MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents to
  understand the requirements and implementation strategy. A key challenge arose
  from conflicting color specifications between these two documents for the new
  themes. While the PLAN suggested distinct "complete color experiences" for
  purple and orange, the PRD explicitly listed values that largely mirrored the
  light theme's text and background, only changing the accent color. Despite the
  PRD also stating themes should be "complete color systems," the assistant
  prioritized the PRD's explicit color values. The implementation involved
  refactoring globals.css to use data-theme attributes for all four themes,
  updating layout.tsx to integrate a ThemeSelector component, and removing the
  old ThemeToggle. The process also involved troubleshooting issues with file
  modification tools, ultimately requiring a direct file overwrite to ensure
  changes were applied.
