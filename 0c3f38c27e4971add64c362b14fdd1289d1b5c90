overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  options, guided by  and . The assistant
  began by reviewing these documents and the existing codebase. A significant
  challenge arose from conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the
  PLAN. While the PLAN offered a more distinct "complete color experience" for
  the new themes, the assistant decided to adhere to the PRD's explicit values,
  which resulted in purple and orange themes sharing text and background colors
  with the light theme, only differing in accent. The implementation involved
  refactoring  to use  attributes, integrating the
   component, and updating the theme initialization logic. The
   component was removed. The process also involved some
  troubleshooting when  updates didn't apply as expected.
