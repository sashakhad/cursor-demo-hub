tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented these themes by updating the CSS, replacing the theme toggle with
  a selector, and deleting the old component, prioritizing the PRD's specific
  color values despite some internal inconsistencies.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  theme options. The assistant began by reviewing the provided
  and  documents to understand the requirements and
  implementation strategy. The core tasks involved updating  to
  define the new themes using  attributes, modifying  to
  integrate a  component, and removing the deprecated
  . A key challenge arose from conflicting color specifications
  between the PRD and the PLAN. While the PLAN suggested a "complete color
  experience" for each new theme, the PRD explicitly listed purple and orange
  themes with only their accent colors differing from the light theme, sharing
  the same text and background colors. Despite the PRD also stating that themes
  should be "complete color systems," the assistant ultimately prioritized the
  PRD's specific color values as the authoritative requirement. The
  implementation successfully updated the CSS, replaced the theme toggling
  mechanism, and cleaned up old components.
