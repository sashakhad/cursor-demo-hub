tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented this by updating the CSS to include new theme definitions,
  replacing the ThemeToggle component with ThemeSelector, and adjusting the
  theme initialization script. A key decision involved resolving conflicting
  color specifications between the PRD and the plan, ultimately prioritizing the
  PRD's explicit values.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The approach involved first
  reviewing the provided product requirements () and
  implementation plan () to understand the scope. The
  assistant then analyzed the existing codebase to identify necessary
  modifications, including updating  for new theme definitions,
  replacing  with  in , and adjusting
  the theme initialization logic. A critical decision point arose from
  conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the plan. Despite the
  plan offering a more "complete color experience" for the new themes, the
  assistant ultimately prioritized the explicit, albeit seemingly inconsistent,
  color values detailed in the PRD. The outcome was the successful integration
  of the orange and purple themes, with  updated to use
   attributes and the theme switching mechanism streamlined.
