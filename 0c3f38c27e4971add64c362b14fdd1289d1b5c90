tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent implemented this by updating the CSS with new theme
  definitions, modifying the layout to use a theme selector, and removing the
  old theme toggle component.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the application's theme system. The agent began by reviewing the
   and  documents to gather requirements and
  an implementation strategy. A significant challenge arose from conflicting
  color specifications between these two documents for the new themes. While the
   suggested distinct, "complete" color experiences for purple and orange,
  the  provided values that largely mirrored the light theme, only changing
  the accent color. Despite this apparent contradiction within the  itself,
  the agent prioritized the 's explicit values as the authoritative source.
  The implementation involved updating  to define the new themes
  using  attributes, modifying  to switch from
   to the existing  component, and removing the
  now-obsolete  file. The agent encountered some technical
  issues with applying the  changes, requiring several attempts to
  ensure the updates were correctly saved.
