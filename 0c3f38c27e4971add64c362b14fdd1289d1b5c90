tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The implementation involved updating CSS with new theme
  definitions, replacing the ThemeToggle component with ThemeSelector, and
  modifying the theme initialization script to support the new themes.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  theme options. The process began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN
  documents to understand the requirements. A key decision was made to follow
  the more detailed color specifications from the PLAN document, which offered a
  "complete color experience" for the new themes, over the PRD which had some
  inconsistencies. The implementation involved updating  to define
  the new themes using  attributes, replacing the
  component with  in , and adjusting the theme
  initialization script to manage the four themes. The  file
  was subsequently removed. The outcome is a theme system that now supports
  light, dark, purple, and orange themes, with a consistent
  attribute approach.
