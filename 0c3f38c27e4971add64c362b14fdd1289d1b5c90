tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent implemented these new themes by updating the CSS to
  use data-theme attributes, incorporating color values from the
  MULTI_THEME_PLAN, and refactoring the theme selection component.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by introducing orange and
  purple theme options. The agent began by reviewing the provided product and
  plan documents to understand the requirements. A key decision was made to
  follow the MULTI_THEME_PLAN's color specifications for the new themes, as they
  offered a more complete and consistent color palette compared to the
  MULTI_THEME_PRD, which appeared to have some inconsistencies. The
  implementation involved updating globals.css to define the new themes using
  data-theme attributes, modifying layout.tsx to integrate a ThemeSelector
  component and an updated theme initialization script, and removing the old
  ThemeToggle component. This successfully added the requested theme options and
  modernized the theme management system.
