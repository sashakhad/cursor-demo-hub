tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented these themes by updating the global CSS, integrating
  an existing theme selector component, and removing the old theme toggle.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  color options. The assistant began by reviewing the provided product and plan
  documents to understand the requirements and then analyzed the existing
  codebase. A key decision involved resolving conflicting color specifications
  between the PRD and the plan, with the assistant prioritizing the plan's more
  detailed and cohesive "complete color experience" for the new themes. The
  implementation involved updating  to define the new themes using
   attributes, modifying  to integrate the existing
   component and update the theme initialization logic, and
  finally deleting the deprecated  component. The outcome is a
  theme system that now supports light, dark, purple, and orange themes.
