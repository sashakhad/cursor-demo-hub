tldr: The agent successfully added orange and purple theme options to the theme
  system. This involved updating the CSS to support data-theme attributes,
  replacing the ThemeToggle component with ThemeSelector, and adjusting the
  theme initialization script.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple theme options. The agent's approach involved a
  comprehensive update to the styling infrastructure. This included refactoring
   to utilize  attributes for theme selection, defining
  the new purple and orange themes with their respective color palettes, and
  integrating a  component to manage theme switching. A
  significant challenge arose from conflicting color specifications between the
   and  documents. The agent ultimately
  prioritized the 's explicit color values for the new themes, which
  resulted in purple and orange themes sharing similar text and background
  colors with the light theme, with only the accent color being distinct. This
  decision was made despite the 's seemingly contradictory requirement for
  "complete color systems." The agent also faced technical hurdles with file
  modification tools, requiring persistent efforts to ensure the CSS changes
  were correctly applied.
