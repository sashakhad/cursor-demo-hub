tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The agent implemented this by updating the CSS with new theme definitions,
  replacing the theme toggle component with a selector, and deleting the old
  component. A key decision involved resolving conflicting color specifications
  between the PRD and the PLAN documents.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the existing theme system. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the
  provided MULTI_THEME_PRD and MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents to understand the
  requirements and implementation strategy. The core tasks involved modifying

   to switch from  to , and removing the
  deprecated  component. A significant challenge arose from
  conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the PLAN. While the PLAN
  suggested distinct color palettes for a "complete" purple and orange
  experience, the PRD explicitly listed values that largely mirrored the light
  theme, only altering the accent color. Despite the PRD's seemingly
  contradictory statement about themes being "complete color systems," the agent
  prioritized the explicit values in the PRD as the authoritative requirements.
  The  was updated accordingly, and the necessary changes to

  completed.
