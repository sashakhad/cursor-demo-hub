tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode with a theme toggle. The
  assistant updated Tailwind CSS config, global CSS variables, created a
  ThemeToggle component, and made several existing components theme-aware. The
  process involved reading PRD/PLAN documents and existing code, then
  systematically applying changes.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  feature, guided by provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant began by
  thoroughly reviewing these documents and then examining relevant existing code
  files to grasp the current structure and color usage. The implementation
  involved a systematic approach: configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode,
  defining CSS variables for both light and dark themes in globals.css,
  developing a ThemeToggle component, and integrating it into the main layout.
  Crucially, numerous existing components like FilteredPosts, Button, TextLink,
  PostLink, Divider, Input, SideBar, and the post page were updated to
  dynamically adapt their styling based on the active theme. During the
  verification phase, a build error related to missing node_modules was
  encountered, prompting the assistant to install the project dependencies."
