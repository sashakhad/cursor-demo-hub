tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle for the
  application. This involved updating core styling configurations, creating a
  new theme toggle component, and refactoring several existing components to be
  theme-aware, ensuring accessibility and proper theme persistence.
overview: "The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme
  toggle, guided by specific PRD and plan documents. The agent began by
  thoroughly reviewing these documents and the existing codebase to understand
  the requirements and current styling patterns. The approach involved a
  systematic update: first, modifying  to enable class-based
  dark mode and map colors to CSS variables. Next,  was updated
  with comprehensive light and dark theme variable definitions. A new
   component was created, and  was updated to
  include a theme initialization script (preventing FOUC) and integrate the
  toggle. Finally, numerous components were refactored to utilize the new
  theme-aware CSS variables, addressing hardcoded colors and borders. The agent
  also handled a build failure by installing dependencies and fixed an ESLint
  error, ensuring a successful and robust dark mode implementation."
