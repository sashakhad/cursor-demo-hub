tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode with a theme toggle,
  following provided PRD and plan documents. This involved updating Tailwind CSS
  configuration, global styles, creating a new theme toggle component, and
  making numerous components theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to add dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application. The agent started by carefully reviewing the
  provided PRD and plan documents, followed by an in-depth analysis of relevant
  code files to understand the existing styling and component structure. The
  approach involved updating the Tailwind CSS configuration to support dark mode
  classes and mapping colors to CSS variables. Global CSS was modified to define
  distinct color palettes for light and dark themes. A new
  component was developed to allow users to switch themes, and an initialization
  script was added to  to apply the correct theme on load. Key
  decisions included using CSS variables for theme-aware styling and updating
  various components to utilize these new variables, addressing hardcoded colors
  and borders. The implementation was verified through a build process, which
  also helped catch and resolve a minor ESLint error. The outcome is a fully
  functional dark mode with a user-controlled toggle.
