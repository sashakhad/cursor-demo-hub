tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle across the
  application. It involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining CSS
  variables for themes, creating a theme toggle component, and making numerous
  components theme-aware.
overview: The user wanted to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  started by reviewing the PRD and plan documents, then analyzed the existing
  codebase, including , , ,
  and several UI components to understand current styling. The approach involved
  enabling dark mode in Tailwind, defining CSS variables for light and dark
  themes, creating a  component, and integrating it into the main
  layout. Many components were updated to use the new theme-aware color
  variables. During verification, the agent handled a build failure by
  installing dependencies and fixed an ESLint error in the
  component. The outcome was a fully functional dark mode implementation with a
  toggle.
