tldr: The user successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature
  across the application. This involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration,
  defining CSS variables for light and dark themes, creating a new theme toggle
  component, and making numerous components theme-aware.
overview: The user initiated the implementation of a dark mode feature with a
  theme toggle. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the provided PRD and
  plan documents, followed by an extensive analysis of the existing codebase,
  including Tailwind configuration, global CSS, layout, and various UI
  components, to understand current styling patterns. A detailed todo list was
  created to guide the implementation. Key steps included configuring Tailwind
  for class-based dark mode, defining a comprehensive set of CSS variables for
  light and dark themes, developing a  component with local storage
  persistence, and integrating it into the main layout. Crucially, numerous
  components were refactored to utilize the new theme-aware CSS variables,
  replacing hardcoded colors and styles. During the process, the agent addressed
  a build failure by installing dependencies and resolved an ESLint error in the
  new  component, ensuring a robust and functional dark mode
  implementation.
