tldr: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle. The
  assistant successfully updated the Tailwind CSS configuration, added
  theme-specific CSS variables, created a new ThemeToggle component, and
  integrated it into the main layout with a client-side theme initialization
  script.
overview: The user's intent was to introduce dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application, adhering to specified PRD and plan documents. The
  assistant began by thoroughly reading the provided documentation and then
  extensively reviewed relevant codebase files, including Tailwind CSS
  configuration, global CSS, layout components, and various UI components, to
  understand existing color patterns and structure. This comprehensive analysis
  led to the creation of a detailed implementation plan. The approach involved
  modifying  to support class-based dark mode and use CSS
  variables for colors, defining light and dark theme variables in
  , developing a  React component, and integrating
  it into  along with a client-side script for initial theme
  detection and application. The outcome is a functional dark mode
  implementation with a user-facing toggle.
