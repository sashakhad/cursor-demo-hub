tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully updated Tailwind CSS
  configuration, global styles, created a theme toggle component, and made
  several existing components theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to introduce a dark mode feature with a
  user-operable theme toggle. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the
  provided product requirements and implementation plan documents. This was
  followed by an extensive analysis of the existing codebase, including Tailwind
  CSS configuration, global styles, layout, and various UI components, to
  understand current styling patterns and identify areas for modification. The
  approach involved a systematic update of tailwind.config.ts to support
  class-based dark mode and CSS variables, defining distinct light and dark
  theme variables in app/globals.css, and developing a ThemeToggle component.
  Key decisions included replacing hardcoded colors and inline styles with
  theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes across multiple components. The
  outcome is a fully functional dark mode implementation with a toggle, ensuring
  a consistent visual experience across the application.
