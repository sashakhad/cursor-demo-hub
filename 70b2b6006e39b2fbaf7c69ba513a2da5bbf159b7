tldr: The user requested the implementation of dark mode with a theme toggle.
  The agent successfully implemented dark mode by updating Tailwind CSS
  configuration, adding CSS variables for themes, creating a new theme toggle
  component, and making various existing components theme-aware.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  providing PRD and plan documents for guidance. The agent began by thoroughly
  reading the provided documents and existing codebase files to understand the
  requirements and current structure. The implementation involved several key
  steps: configuring Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode and mapping colors
  to CSS variables, defining light and dark theme CSS variables in
  , creating a new  component, and integrating it into
   with a script to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC).
  Additionally, numerous existing components like , ,
  , , , , , and the post page were
  updated to use the new theme-aware color variables and classes. Minor issues,
  such as missing dependencies and an ESLint error, were addressed and resolved
  during the process. The final implementation successfully provides a
  functional, accessible, and persistent dark mode experience."
