tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully updated the styling, created a theme toggle component, and made
  all relevant components theme-aware, resolving a build issue along the way.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle.
  The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the project's PRD and plan documents,
  followed by an in-depth analysis of the existing codebase, including Tailwind
  configuration, global CSS, and various UI components, to understand current
  styling patterns. A detailed implementation plan was then formulated. The
  agent proceeded to update  for dark mode, define
  comprehensive light and dark theme CSS variables in , and
  create a  component integrated into . Crucially,
  many existing components were refactored to replace hardcoded colors and
  inline styles with dynamic, theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes.
  During verification, a build failure occurred due to missing dependencies,
  which the agent promptly resolved by installing them, ensuring a successful
  dark mode implementation.
