tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature.
  This involved updating Tailwind CSS configuration, defining CSS variables for
  light and dark themes, creating a new  component, and making
  various existing components theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to add a dark mode feature with a theme toggle
  to the application, adhering to specified product and plan documents. The
  agent began by thoroughly reviewing these documents and the existing codebase
  to understand the current structure and color usage. The approach involved
  updating the Tailwind CSS configuration to support class-based dark mode,
  defining comprehensive CSS variables for both light and dark themes, and
  creating a dedicated  component. Key decisions included replacing
  hardcoded colors and inline styles with theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind
  classes across various components like , , ,
  , , , , and the post pages. After an
  initial build failure due to missing dependencies, the agent installed them
  and successfully re-ran the build, completing the dark mode implementation.
