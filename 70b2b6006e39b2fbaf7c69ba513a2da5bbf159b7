tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The
  assistant successfully updated Tailwind CSS configuration, added global CSS
  variables for light and dark themes, created a theme toggle component, and
  made several existing components theme-aware.

  toggle to the application. The approach involved first understanding the
  requirements from PRD and plan documents, then analyzing the existing
  codebase's structure and color usage. Key decisions included using Tailwind
  CSS's 'class' dark mode strategy and defining CSS variables for theme colors.
