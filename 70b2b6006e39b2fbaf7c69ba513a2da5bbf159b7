tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle following
  specific PRD and plan documents. The agent successfully updated Tailwind CSS
  configuration, defined theme-specific CSS variables, created a theme toggle
  component, and refactored multiple UI components to be theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate a dark mode feature and a theme
  toggle into the application. The agent began by reviewing the project's PRD
  and plan documents, followed by an extensive analysis of the existing
  codebase, including Tailwind configuration, global CSS, layout, and various UI
  components, to understand current styling patterns. The approach involved
  enabling dark mode via Tailwind's class strategy, defining distinct CSS
  variables for light and dark themes, and developing a  component.
  Key decisions included replacing hardcoded colors and inline styles with
  theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes across the application. The
  outcome is a fully functional dark mode with a user-controlled toggle,
  ensuring a consistent visual experience across different themes.
