tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent successfully integrated dark mode
  by updating CSS variables, Tailwind configuration, adding a theme toggle
  component, and refactoring numerous components to use theme-aware styling.
overview: The user's intent was to introduce dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application, adhering to specific design and implementation
  documents. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing these documents to
  understand the requirements and then proceeded with a structured approach.
  This involved updating the tailwind.config.ts to enable dark mode and map
  colors to CSS variables, defining light and dark theme variables in
  globals.css, and creating a ThemeToggle.tsx component. A crucial step was
  adding a theme initialization script to layout.tsx to prevent Flash of
  Unstyled Content (FOUC). The agent then systematically refactored numerous
  existing components like FilteredPosts, Button, TextLink, PostLink, Input,
  Divider, SideBar, and the post detail page to replace hardcoded colors and
  inline styles with the newly defined theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind
  classes. This comprehensive approach ensured that the dark mode was
  consistently applied throughout the application, resulting in a fully
  functional and theme-responsive user interface.
