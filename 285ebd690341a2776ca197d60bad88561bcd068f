tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle following
  provided PRD and plan documents. The assistant successfully implemented
  comprehensive dark mode support, including CSS variables, a theme toggle
  component, FOUC prevention, and updated all relevant components to be
  theme-aware.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  providing detailed PRD and plan documents. The assistant began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents to understand the requirements and design
  principles. The approach involved setting up CSS variables for theming,
  configuring Tailwind CSS for dark mode, and creating a
  component. A crucial step was adding a theme initialization script to
   to prevent a 'flash of unstyled content' (FOUC). All existing
  components were then systematically updated to utilize the new theme-aware
  color tokens, replacing hardcoded colors and inline styles with Tailwind
  utilities. A specific modification was made to the arrow icon in
   by adding a  filter for better visibility in dark
  mode. The outcome is a fully functional and accessible dark mode
  implementation that adheres to the specified design and technical
  requirements, ensuring a consistent user experience.
