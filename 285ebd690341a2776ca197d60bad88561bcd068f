tldr: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle
  based on provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent successfully implemented
  the feature by updating CSS variables, Tailwind configuration, adding a theme
  toggle component, and refactoring existing components to be theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle into the application. The agent approached this by first thoroughly
  reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements
  and design specifications. It then systematically updated the application's
  styling infrastructure, including  and , to
  support CSS variables for theming. A new  component was
  developed, and a crucial theme initialization script was added to
  to prevent flashes of unstyled content (FOUC). Key decisions involved adhering
  to the specified color token usage (e.g.,  for active states,
   for backgrounds,  for accent areas, and
  for general text). The agent also performed a comprehensive audit and
  refactoring of multiple existing components like , ,
  , , , , and  to ensure they
  correctly utilized the new theme-aware color tokens. The outcome is a fully
  functional dark mode implementation with a user-controlled theme toggle,
  consistent with the provided design guidelines.
