tldr: The user requested a comprehensive dark mode implementation with a theme
  toggle. The agent successfully implemented dark mode by updating Tailwind
  configuration, defining CSS variables, creating a theme toggle component, and
  updating all relevant components to be theme-aware, including FOUC prevention.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  referencing detailed PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents to understand the requirements, which included using
  CSS variables, updating Tailwind configuration, adding a theme initialization
  script to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC), and creating a
   component. The agent then systematically updated various
  components like , , , , ,
  , , and the post detail page to utilize the new theme-aware
  color tokens and remove hardcoded styles. A key decision involved adding a
   filter to an SVG arrow icon to ensure its visibility in dark
  mode. The entire implementation was committed with a conventional commit
  message, resulting in a fully functional and accessible dark mode experience
  across the application.
