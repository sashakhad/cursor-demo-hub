  toggle. The assistant successfully implemented this by following detailed PRD
  and PLAN documents, updating styling, and creating a new toggle component.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  across the application. The assistant began by carefully reviewing the
  provided  and  documents to understand all
  requirements and specifications. The implementation involved updating
   to enable dark mode and map colors to CSS variables,
  defining light and dark mode CSS variables in , and creating a
  new  component. A script was added to  to prevent
  Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). Subsequently, the assistant systematically
  updated numerous existing components, including FilteredPosts, Button,
  TextLink, PostLink, Input, Divider, SideBar, and the post detail page, to
  utilize the new theme-aware color tokens and replace hardcoded styles or
  inline styles. A specific adjustment was made to the  component to
  invert the arrow icon in dark mode. All changes were then committed with a
  descriptive conventional commit message.
