tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature.
  This involved setting up CSS variables, updating Tailwind CSS configuration,
  creating a theme toggle component, and refactoring various UI components to be
  theme-aware.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  providing detailed PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly
  reviewing these documents to grasp the project requirements. The
  implementation involved a systematic approach: first, configuring
   and  to establish CSS variables for theming
  and enable dark mode. Next, a  component was created, and a theme
  initialization script was integrated into  to prevent Flash of
  Unstyled Content (FOUC). Subsequently, a comprehensive refactoring of existing
  UI components such as , , , ,
  , , , and post detail pages was undertaken to ensure
  they utilized the new theme-aware color tokens and removed any hardcoded
  styles. A key decision was made to address the  icon, which
  was not theme-aware, by applying a  class to ensure its
  visibility in dark mode. The agent also performed linter checks to maintain
  code quality throughout the process."
