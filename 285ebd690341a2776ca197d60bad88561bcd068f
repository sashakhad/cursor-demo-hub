  configuration, creating a new theme toggle component, and refactoring existing
  components to be theme-aware.

  Next,  was updated to define distinct CSS variables for both
  light and dark themes. A new  component was created, and
   was modified to include this toggle and a theme initialization
  script to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). Finally, a comprehensive
  refactoring of various components such as , ,
  , , , , , and
  the post detail page was performed to ensure they correctly utilized the new
  theme-aware color tokens and removed any hardcoded styles. A specific
  adjustment was made to the arrow icon in  by adding a
   class to ensure its visibility in dark mode. The agent operated
  with high autonomy, making decisions and implementing changes in batches, and
  providing a high-level summary of the work done."
