tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent successfully implemented a new
  component, updated the CSS to support multiple themes via
  attributes, and integrated the new selector into the application layout, while
  also resolving issues with tool output reliability.
overview: The user initiated a request to expand the application's theme system
  by adding orange and purple theme options. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided  and  documents to understand the
  requirements and implementation details. It then analyzed the existing theme
  structure, identifying the  component,  definitions,
  and  integration points. The core approach involved replacing the
   with a new  dropdown component, updating
   to use  attributes for all themes (light, dark,
  purple, orange), and modifying  to incorporate the new selector
  and an updated theme initialization script. A key decision was to prioritize
  the color specifications from the  when discrepancies arose
  with the PRD. The agent also faced challenges with the  and
   tools, which repeatedly showed stale file content, but
  successfully debugged this by using  and terminal commands to confirm
  the changes were correctly applied to the file system. The implementation was
  completed by deleting the old  component, resulting in a fully
  functional multi-theme system.
