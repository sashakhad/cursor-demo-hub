tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. This involved creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating
  globals.css with new theme definitions, and modifying layout.tsx to integrate
  the new theme selection system.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The approach involved a
  comprehensive refactor of the existing theme mechanism. The ThemeToggle
  component was replaced with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown. Key
  decisions included adopting [data-theme] attributes for CSS theme definitions
  and resolving conflicting color specifications between the PRD and PLAN
  documents by adhering to the PLAN's detailed implementation guide. The outcome
  is a flexible theme system supporting light, dark, purple, and orange options,
  enhancing user customization.
