tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The agent implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS to support
  multiple themes via data attributes, and adjusted the theme initialization
  script. There was an initial discrepancy in color values between the PRD and
  PLAN, which was resolved by adhering to the PRD's specifications for the new
  themes.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the application. The agent began by analyzing the provided PRD and PLAN
  documents, along with the existing theme implementation. This involved
  replacing the current  with a new  dropdown
  component, updating  to support  attributes for all
  themes, and modifying  accordingly. Initially, there was a
  conflict between the PRD and PLAN regarding specific color values for the new
  themes. The agent first implemented colors based on the PLAN for a "complete
  experience" but later pivoted to align with the PRD's specifications, which
  dictated that the purple and orange themes should share the light theme's base
  text and background colors, with only their accent colors being unique. The
  agent also faced challenges with tool output, where  showed
  outdated content despite  indicating success, necessitating
  the use of terminal commands to verify file changes.
