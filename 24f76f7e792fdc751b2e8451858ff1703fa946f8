tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS
  with new theme definitions, and modified the layout to support the new themes,
  resolving initial issues with CSS updates and theme initialization.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided PRD and plan documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. The core changes involved
  replacing the simple  with a more versatile
  dropdown component. The  file was refactored to use
   attributes for theme selection, and detailed color variables
  for the new purple and orange themes were added based on the implementation
  plan. The  file was updated to integrate the new selector and a
  more robust theme initialization script. During the process, the agent
  encountered challenges with the  tool not consistently
  applying CSS changes, which was debugged by using  and terminal commands
  to verify file contents directly on disk. The  component's
  theme loading logic was also improved to ensure consistent theme application.
  The outcome is a fully functional multi-theme system with light, dark, purple,
  and orange options, selectable via a dropdown, with persistent theme settings.
