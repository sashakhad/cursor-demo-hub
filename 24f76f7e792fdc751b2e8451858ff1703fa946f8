tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. The assistant implemented a new theme selector component, updated
  the CSS to support multiple themes using data attributes, and integrated the
  new themes into the application layout.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then analyzed the existing theme
  implementation, which used a simple toggle and  CSS classes. The
  approach involved replacing the  with a new
  dropdown component, refactoring the CSS to utilize  attributes
  for theme switching, and updating the  file to integrate the new
  selector and theme initialization logic. A key decision involved resolving
  conflicting color specifications for the orange theme between the PRD and
  PLAN, with the PLAN being prioritized for its detailed implementation
  guidance. After implementing the changes and correcting an initial CSS update
  error, the assistant verified the component and CSS, confirming the successful
  addition of the new themes.
