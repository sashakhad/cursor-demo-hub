tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS to
  support the new themes, and adjusted the theme initialization logic, resolving
  discrepancies between the PRD and PLAN regarding theme color specifications.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple theme options. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and plan documents, then analyzed the existing theme
  implementation. The core changes involved replacing the simple ThemeToggle
  with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown component, updating globals.css
  to define the new themes using [data-theme] attributes, and modifying
  layout.tsx to integrate the new selector and theme initialization logic. A key
  challenge was resolving conflicting color specifications between the PRD and
  the implementation plan; the assistant ultimately prioritized the PRD's
  specific color values for the new themes, which meant purple and orange shared
  the light theme's text and background colors, differing only in accent.
  Troubleshooting also involved addressing tool inconsistencies where file
  changes weren't immediately reflected, requiring direct terminal commands for
  verification. The final outcome is a theme system supporting light, dark,
  purple, and orange options, with selection persisting via localStorage.
