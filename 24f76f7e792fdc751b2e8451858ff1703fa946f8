tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented this by creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating the CSS
  to support data-theme attributes for multiple themes, and modifying the layout
  to integrate the new selector.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. It developed a new
  component to replace the simple toggle, allowing users to choose from light,
  dark, purple, and orange themes. The core CSS file () was
  refactored to use  attributes for theme definitions,
  incorporating the new color palettes specified in the PLAN document. The main
  application layout () was updated to integrate the new selector
  and adjust the theme initialization logic. Despite some initial challenges
  with file updates not appearing to apply, the assistant successfully completed
  the task, ensuring all themes were correctly implemented and the old theme
  component was removed.
