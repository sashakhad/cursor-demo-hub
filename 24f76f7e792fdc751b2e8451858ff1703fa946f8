tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated
  global CSS with new theme definitions, and modified the layout to use the new
  selector, successfully adding the requested themes.
overview: The user initiated the task to expand the theme system by introducing
  orange and purple theme options. The assistant began by reviewing the provided
  PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then analyzed the
  existing theme implementation. Key changes involved replacing the simple
   with a more versatile  dropdown component,
  updating  to support  attributes for all four
  themes (light, dark, purple, orange), and modifying  to integrate
  the new selector and its theme initialization logic. A notable challenge was
  resolving conflicting color specifications between the PRD and PLAN, with the
  PLAN being chosen as the authoritative source. The assistant also faced
  persistent issues with the  tool showing stale content, which led
  to repeated verification steps using  and terminal commands to confirm
  that the changes were correctly applied to the files on disk. Despite these
  tool-related hurdles, the implementation was successfully completed, providing
  a robust multi-theme system.
