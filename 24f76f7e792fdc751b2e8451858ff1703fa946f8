tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated the
  layout.tsx to use it, and removed the old ThemeToggle. However, the
  globals.css file, which defines the actual theme colors, was not successfully
  updated by the end of the conversation.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The approach involved replacing
  the existing ThemeToggle with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown. Key
  decisions included following the MULTI_THEME_PLAN for specific color values
  when discrepancies arose with the MULTI_THEME_PRD. The ThemeSelector component
  was successfully implemented and integrated into layout.tsx, and the old
  ThemeToggle was removed. However, a critical part of the task, updating
  globals.css with the actual color definitions for the new themes and switching
  to [data-theme] selectors, repeatedly failed to apply, leaving the core theme
  definitions incomplete at the end of the conversation.
