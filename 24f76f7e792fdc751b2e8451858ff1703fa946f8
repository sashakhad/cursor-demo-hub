tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant implemented a new dropdown theme selector, updated
  CSS to support four distinct themes (light, dark, purple, orange) using
   attributes, and ensured theme persistence.
overview: The user wanted to expand the application's theme system to include
  orange and purple options, in addition to the existing light and dark themes.
  The assistant began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN documents, then
  analyzed the current theme implementation. The approach involved replacing the
  existing  component with a new  dropdown, updating
   to define the four themes using  attributes, and
  modifying  to integrate the new selector and an updated theme
  initialization script. A key decision involved resolving conflicting color
  specifications between the PRD and PLAN, ultimately opting for the PLAN's more
  distinct "complete color systems" for purple and orange. The assistant also
  had to troubleshoot issues where file changes weren't immediately reflected by
  the  tool, confirming updates via  and terminal commands. The
  final outcome is a robust theme system with a user-friendly dropdown selector
  and persistent theme choices.
