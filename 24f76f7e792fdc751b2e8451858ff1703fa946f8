tldr: The user asked to add orange and purple themes to the system. The
  assistant created a new ThemeSelector component and updated globals.css with
  the new theme definitions, resolving a color discrepancy by following the
  MULTI_THEME_PLAN.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system to include orange and
  purple options. The assistant started by reviewing the provided PRD and plan
  documents, then examined the existing theme implementation. It identified the
  need to replace the current ThemeToggle with a ThemeSelector dropdown, update
  globals.css to use [data-theme] attributes for theme definitions, and add the
  new purple and orange color schemes. A key decision was to follow the
  MULTI_THEME_PLAN for specific color values due to a discrepancy with the PRD.
  The ThemeSelector component was created, and globals.css was updated with the
  new theme definitions. The next steps involve updating layout.tsx and deleting
  the old ThemeToggle.
