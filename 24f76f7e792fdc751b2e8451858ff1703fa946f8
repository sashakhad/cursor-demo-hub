tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. This involved creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating
  globals.css with new theme definitions, and modifying layout.tsx to integrate
  the new theme system.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided MULTI_THEME_PRD and MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents to understand the
  requirements and implementation details. It then analyzed the existing theme
  infrastructure, including ThemeToggle.tsx, globals.css, and layout.tsx. The
  core approach involved replacing the simple ThemeToggle with a more versatile
  ThemeSelector dropdown, updating globals.css to use [data-theme] attributes
  for theme definitions, and adjusting layout.tsx to accommodate these changes.
  A key decision was to adhere to the MULTI_THEME_PLAN for specific color
  values, even when minor differences were noted with the MULTI_THEME_PRD. The
  agent faced some challenges with the search_replace tool not consistently
  applying changes to globals.css, requiring repeated attempts to ensure the
  correct theme definitions were in place. Ultimately, the new theme options
  were successfully integrated, and the old ThemeToggle component was removed.
