tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. This involved replacing the old theme toggle with a new theme
  selector dropdown, updating the CSS to support multiple themes via data
  attributes, and integrating the new themes into the application layout.
overview: The user wanted to expand the application's theme system by adding
  orange and purple color options. The agent started by reviewing the provided
  PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and color
  specifications. It then analyzed the existing theme implementation, which used
  a simple toggle and CSS classes. The approach involved creating a new
   component with a dropdown to allow users to choose between
  light, dark, purple, and orange themes. The  file was refactored
  to use  attributes for theme definitions, and the specific color
  palettes for orange and purple were integrated based on the PLAN document. The
   file was updated to incorporate the new selector and a revised
  theme initialization script. During the process, the agent resolved
  discrepancies in color values between the PRD and PLAN by prioritizing the
  more detailed PLAN document. The old  component was removed,
  successfully implementing the multi-theme system.
