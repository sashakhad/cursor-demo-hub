tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant created a new  component to replace
  the old , allowing users to select between light, dark, purple,
  and orange themes via a dropdown.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple theme options. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and plan documents, then analyzed the current theme
  implementation, which used a simple toggle and a class-based dark mode. A key
  decision was made to prioritize the color specifications from the
   due to its comprehensive details, despite minor differences
  with the PRD. The approach involved replacing the existing  with
  a new  component, which is a dropdown. This new component
  handles setting a  attribute on the document element to manage
  theme changes. The  component has been implemented, and the
  next steps involve updating CSS for the new theme definitions, integrating the
  selector into the layout, and removing the old toggle component.
