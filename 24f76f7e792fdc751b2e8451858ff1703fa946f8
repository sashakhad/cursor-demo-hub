tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The agent implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS with new
  theme definitions, and modified the layout to support the new themes,
  resolving discrepancies between design documents along the way.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  color options. The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and PLAN
  documents, then analyzed the existing theme implementation. It was determined
  that the current ThemeToggle component needed to be replaced with a dropdown
  ThemeSelector, the CSS theme definitions in globals.css needed to be updated
  to use data-theme attributes, and the layout.tsx file required modifications
  to integrate the new selector and theme initialization logic. During
  implementation, a discrepancy in orange theme color values between the PRD and
  PLAN was identified, and the agent prioritized the PLAN for its detailed
  implementation guidance. After successfully creating the ThemeSelector,
  updating globals.css with the new theme colors, and modifying layout.tsx, the
  old ThemeToggle component was removed. The agent also verified the changes and
  checked for linter errors.
