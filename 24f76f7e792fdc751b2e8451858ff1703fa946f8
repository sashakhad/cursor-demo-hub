tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application. This involved creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating
  globals.css with new theme definitions, and modifying layout.tsx to integrate
  the new selector and theme initialization logic.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theming capabilities
  by introducing distinct orange and purple color schemes. The approach involved
  a comprehensive refactor of the existing theme system. A new ThemeSelector
  component was developed to provide a dropdown for theme selection, replacing
  the simpler ThemeToggle. The core CSS theming mechanism in globals.css was
  migrated from :root and .dark classes to a more flexible [data-theme]
  attribute system, allowing for easy integration of the new purple and orange
  themes. Key decisions included adhering to the MULTI_THEME_PLAN for precise
  color definitions, which led to a correction in the orange theme's accent and
  secondary colors. The layout.tsx file was updated to incorporate the new
  selector and a streamlined theme initialization script. The task is largely
  complete, with the final step of removing the old ThemeToggle component
  remaining.
