tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The agent
  implemented a new theme selector component, updated CSS with new theme
  definitions, and modified the layout to support the new themes. The changes
  were successfully applied despite initial tool output inconsistencies.
overview: The user wanted to expand the application's theme system by adding
  orange and purple color options. The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD
  and plan documents to understand the requirements and then analyzed the
  existing theme implementation. The approach involved creating a new
   component (a dropdown) to replace the existing ,
  updating  to define the new themes using
  attributes, and modifying  to integrate the new selector and
  adjust the theme initialization logic. A key challenge was ensuring the
   updates were correctly applied and reflected, as the
  tool initially showed stale content, necessitating verification with
  and direct terminal commands. The  component was also improved
  to ensure robust theme persistence by checking . Ultimately, the
  orange and purple themes were successfully integrated, providing users with
  more customization options.
