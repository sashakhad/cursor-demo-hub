tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS with new theme
  definitions, and adjusted the layout, resolving discrepancies between PRD and
  PLAN documents regarding color values.
overview: The user wanted to expand the theme system by adding orange and purple
  theme options. The approach involved replacing the existing  with
  a new  dropdown component, updating the global CSS to define
  these new themes using  attributes, and modifying the main
  layout to integrate the new selector and theme initialization logic. A key
  decision point was resolving conflicting color specifications between the
   and  documents; the assistant ultimately
  prioritized the 's detailed "complete color system" definitions for
  purple and orange. Technical challenges included tool inconsistencies in
  applying and verifying file changes, which were overcome by using alternative
  verification methods. The final outcome is a flexible theme system with light,
  dark, purple, and orange options, selectable via a dropdown, with persistent
  theme settings.
