tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated
  CSS to support data-theme attributes for multiple themes, and integrated the
  new themes into the application's layout.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and plan documents, then analyzed the existing theme
  implementation. Key steps involved replacing the ThemeToggle component with a
  more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown, refactoring the CSS to use [data-theme]
  attributes for theme application, and integrating the new theme options into
  the application's main layout. A minor challenge involved reconciling
  conflicting color values between the PRD and plan, which was resolved by
  adhering to the more detailed implementation plan. The process concluded with
  the successful implementation of the new themes and verification of the
  changes.
