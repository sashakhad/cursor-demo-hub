tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The agent
  implemented this by creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating the CSS
  with new theme definitions, and integrating it into the layout. The new themes
  are now available via a dropdown selector.
overview: The user wanted to expand the application's theme system to include
  orange and purple color schemes. The agent approached this by first reviewing
  the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and color
  specifications. It then refactored the existing theme implementation,
  replacing a simple toggle with a new  dropdown component. The
  core CSS file () was updated to support  attributes
  for light, dark, purple, and orange themes, with detailed color definitions
  derived from the PLAN document. The application's main layout ()
  was adjusted to integrate the new selector and ensure proper theme
  initialization. Despite some initial confusion with file update verification,
  the agent successfully confirmed all changes were applied, resulting in a
  flexible multi-theme system with persistent user preferences.
