tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The agent
  implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS with new theme
  definitions, and modified the layout to use the new selector. The agent also
  resolved discrepancies in color values and tool-related issues during
  implementation.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the existing theme system, guided by the MULTI_THEME_PRD and
  MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the
  existing theme implementation and the provided documentation. The core of the
  implementation involved creating a new  component, a dropdown
  that replaced the previous . This new component supports light,
  dark, purple, and orange themes. The  file was refactored to use
   attributes for theme-specific styling, and the new purple and
  orange theme color variables were added based on the PLAN document. The
   file was updated to import and utilize the , and
  its theme initialization script was adjusted accordingly. The old
   component was then removed. During the process, the agent
  addressed a conflict in color specifications between the PRD and PLAN, opting
  for the PLAN's values. A notable challenge was the  tool
  consistently showing outdated content for , which was resolved by
  using  and direct terminal commands to confirm the changes were indeed
  applied to the file system. The  component was also refined to
  ensure robust theme persistence by checking  directly. The
  implementation was verified for correct styling and accessibility attributes.
