tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. This involved creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating
  global CSS with new theme definitions, modifying the layout to use the new
  selector, and removing the old theme toggle.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. The core approach involved
  replacing the current  component with a new
  dropdown, updating  to define the new themes using
  attributes, and modifying  to integrate the new selector and
  adjust the theme initialization logic. A key decision was to follow the more
  detailed color specifications in the  when conflicts with
  the PRD arose. The agent faced and resolved issues with applying CSS changes,
  ultimately ensuring the correct theme definitions were in place. The old
   component was removed, and the final implementation included a
  fully functional theme selection system with light, dark, purple, and orange
  options.
