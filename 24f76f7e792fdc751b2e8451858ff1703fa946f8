tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS
  to support the new themes, and modified the layout to use the new selector.
  There were some initial issues with conflicting color specifications between
  the PRD and plan, which were resolved by prioritizing the PRD values for
  certain colors.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the theme system by adding orange
  and purple theme options. The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD and
  plan documents to understand the requirements and implementation strategy. The
  existing  component was replaced with a new
  dropdown, allowing users to choose between Light, Dark, Purple, and Orange
  themes. The  file was refactored to use  attributes
  for theme styling, and the  file was updated to integrate the new
  selector and its initialization logic. A key challenge involved resolving
  conflicting color specifications between the PRD and the plan documents; the
  agent ultimately prioritized the PRD for core color values (text, background,
  card) while maintaining the distinct accent colors from the plan. The agent
  also addressed perceived inconsistencies with file updates by thoroughly
  verifying changes using  and terminal commands, as the  tool
  appeared to show cached content. The  component was further
  refined to ensure robust theme persistence by checking
  directly.
