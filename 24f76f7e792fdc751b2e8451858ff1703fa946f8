tldr: The user requested adding orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS to
  support [data-theme] selectors for all four themes, and resolved discrepancies
  in color definitions between the PRD and PLAN documents.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the theme system by introducing
  orange and purple theme options. The assistant began by reviewing the provided
  PRD and PLAN documents, then analyzed the existing theme implementation. The
  core changes involved replacing the simple ThemeToggle with a more versatile
  ThemeSelector dropdown component and refactoring the CSS to use [data-theme]
  attributes for theme application. A key challenge was reconciling conflicting
  color definitions for the new themes between the PRD and PLAN. After some
  deliberation and a user report of changes not being visible (which was
  attributed to caching/restart needs), the assistant decided to implement the
  more comprehensive color systems outlined in the PLAN for the purple and
  orange themes, ensuring they were distinct rather than just accent variations.
  The ThemeSelector was also improved to robustly load theme preferences.
