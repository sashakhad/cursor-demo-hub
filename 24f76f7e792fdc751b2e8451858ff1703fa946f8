tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented a new theme selector component, updated the CSS to support
  multiple themes using data attributes, and integrated the new themes into the
  application layout.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. The approach involved replacing
  the current  component with a new  dropdown,
  updating  to define theme-specific CSS variables using
   attributes, and modifying  to integrate the new
  selector and theme initialization logic. A key decision was to follow the
   for specific color values when discrepancies arose with the
  PRD. Despite initial challenges with applying CSS changes, the assistant
  successfully implemented the new themes, ensuring the system now supports
  light, dark, purple, and orange options.
