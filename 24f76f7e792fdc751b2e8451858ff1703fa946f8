tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The agent
  implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS with new theme
  definitions, and adjusted the layout, overcoming initial issues with file
  updates and a minor bug in theme loading.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the theme system by introducing
  orange and purple color options. The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD
  and plan documents, then analyzed the existing theme implementation. The core
  approach involved replacing the current  with a new
   dropdown component, updating  to support
   attributes for all four themes (Light, Dark, Purple, Orange),
  and modifying  to integrate the new selector and its theme
  initialization logic. During implementation, the agent navigated conflicting
  color specifications between the PRD and plan, opting for the more detailed
  plan. A significant challenge was ensuring the  updates were
  correctly applied and reflected, as the  tool's output was
  inconsistent with subsequent  calls, necessitating direct terminal
  verification. Finally, a minor bug in the 's  hook
  was identified and fixed to ensure themes were consistently loaded from
   on component mount. The task concluded with all specified theme
  options successfully integrated and functional.
