tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  This involved creating a new ThemeSelector component, updating globals.css
  with new theme definitions, and modifying layout.tsx to integrate the new
  selector and theme logic.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theming capabilities
  by introducing orange and purple color schemes. The approach involved a
  comprehensive update to the theme system. The existing ThemeToggle component
  was replaced with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown. The core CSS
  definitions in globals.css were refactored to use [data-theme] attributes,
  allowing for distinct light, dark, purple, and orange themes. Key decisions
  included prioritizing the MULTI_THEME_PLAN document for specific color values
  due to its detailed nature, and correcting color definitions for the orange
  theme to ensure accuracy. The outcome is a more robust and extensible theme
  system with new color options and an improved user interface for theme
  selection.
