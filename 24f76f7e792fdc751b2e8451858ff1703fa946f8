tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the
  application, replacing the existing theme toggle with a dropdown selector. The
  assistant successfully implemented the new ThemeSelector component and updated
  the layout, but encountered a persistent issue with applying the new theme
  definitions to globals.css.
overview: "The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. This involved replacing the
  existing ThemeToggle component with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown.
  The assistant successfully created the ThemeSelector.tsx component, updated
  layout.tsx to integrate it, and removed the old ThemeToggle. A key decision
  was to prioritize the MULTI_THEME_PLAN document for specific color values, as
  it offered more detailed and distinct theme definitions compared to the PRD.
  However, the implementation faced a significant hurdle: repeated attempts to
  update globals.css with the new [data-theme] selectors and color variables for
  all themes consistently failed to persist, leaving the CSS file in its
  original state by the end of the conversation."
