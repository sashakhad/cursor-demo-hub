tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The assistant
  implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS with new theme
  definitions, and modified the layout to support the new themes, resolving
  discrepancies between PRD and PLAN documents and addressing initial
  implementation issues.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the theme system by adding orange
  and purple theme options. The assistant began by reviewing the provided PRD
  and PLAN documents, then analyzed the existing theme implementation. Key
  changes involved replacing the  component with a more versatile
   dropdown, updating  to incorporate
  selectors for all four themes (light, dark, purple, orange), and adjusting
   to integrate the new selector and its theme initialization logic.
  A significant challenge was resolving conflicting color specifications between
  the PRD and PLAN; the assistant ultimately prioritized the PLAN's detailed
  "complete color systems" for the new themes. Multiple attempts were needed to
  ensure CSS changes were correctly applied and persisted, with verification
  relying on  and terminal commands due to inconsistent
  results. The  was also improved to robustly handle theme
  persistence. The task concluded with a fully functional multi-theme system.
