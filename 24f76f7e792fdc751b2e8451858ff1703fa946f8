tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options. The agent
  implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated globals.css with new theme
  definitions, and modified layout.tsx to integrate the new system, successfully
  expanding the theme capabilities.
overview: The user wanted to enhance the application's theming capabilities by
  introducing orange and purple options. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided PRD and plan documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. The approach involved creating a
  new ThemeSelector dropdown component to replace the old ThemeToggle, updating
  the globals.css file to define the new themes using [data-theme] attributes,
  and modifying layout.tsx to integrate the new selector and theme
  initialization logic. A key decision was to follow the MULTI_THEME_PLAN for
  precise color specifications, which led to a correction in the orange theme's
  accent and secondary colors. The agent faced some challenges with the
  search_replace tool not consistently applying changes to globals.css,
  requiring multiple verification steps and re-attempts. Ultimately, the theme
  system was successfully upgraded to support the new color schemes.
