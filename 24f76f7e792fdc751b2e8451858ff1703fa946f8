tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated
  the CSS to support multiple themes using data attributes, and integrated the
  new themes into the application layout.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color schemes. The assistant began by reviewing
  the provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation, which involved a ThemeToggle
  component and CSS definitions. A key decision was to replace the toggle with a
  dropdown ThemeSelector and transition the CSS from  and  classes
  to  attributes for better multi-theme support. The assistant
  encountered a minor discrepancy in color values between the PRD and PLAN,
  opting to follow the PLAN's more comprehensive color specifications. During
  implementation, there were repeated issues with the  file not
  appearing to update via  after  calls, which was
  eventually confirmed to be a tool-specific caching or display issue, as
  and direct terminal commands verified the changes were correctly applied to
  the file system. The final outcome is a fully functional multi-theme system
  with light, dark, purple, and orange options, managed by the new ThemeSelector
  component.
