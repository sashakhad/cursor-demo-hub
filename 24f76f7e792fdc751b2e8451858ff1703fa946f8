tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated
  CSS with new theme definitions, and modified the layout to support multiple
  themes, resolving initial issues with file updates and theme loading.
overview: The user initiated a task to integrate orange and purple theme options
  into the application's theme system, guided by provided PRD and plan
  documents. The assistant began by analyzing the existing theme implementation,
  which involved a  component and CSS definitions. A new
   component was developed as a dropdown, replacing the old
  toggle. The  file was extensively modified to support
   attributes for light, dark, purple, and orange themes,
  incorporating specific color palettes from the plan. The  file was
  updated to utilize the new selector and an enhanced theme initialization
  script. During implementation, a minor discrepancy in color values between the
  PRD and plan was resolved by adhering to the plan's specifications. Initial
  challenges with file updates not being immediately reflected by the
   tool were overcome by verifying changes directly on disk using
   and terminal commands. Following user feedback about the changes not
  being implemented, the  component's theme loading logic was
  further refined to ensure robust theme persistence and application.
