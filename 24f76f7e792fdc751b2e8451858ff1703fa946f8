tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the existing
  theme system. The agent implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated the
  CSS to support data-theme attributes for multiple themes, and integrated the
  new themes into the application layout.
overview: The user initiated a task to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The agent began by reviewing the
  provided PRD and PLAN documents to understand the requirements and then
  analyzed the existing theme implementation. Key steps involved replacing the
  current  with a new  dropdown component, updating
   to support  attributes for all themes (light,
  dark, purple, orange), and integrating these changes into . During
  implementation, the agent carefully reconciled conflicting color
  specifications between the PRD and PLAN, ultimately adhering to the PLAN for
  precise color values. The theme initialization script was also updated to
  reflect the new multi-theme system. The outcome is a more flexible theme
  system with expanded color choices.
