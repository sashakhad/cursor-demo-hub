tldr: The user requested to add orange and purple theme options to the system.
  The assistant implemented a new ThemeSelector component, updated CSS to
  support multiple themes, and configured the application to use the new themes,
  resolving discrepancies between design documents and ensuring theme
  persistence.
overview: The user's intent was to expand the application's theme system by
  introducing orange and purple color options. The approach involved replacing
  the existing ThemeToggle with a more versatile ThemeSelector dropdown,
  updating the global CSS to support [data-theme] attributes for theme
  switching, and modifying the application's layout to integrate these changes.
  A key decision involved navigating conflicting color specifications between
  the MULTI_THEME_PRD and MULTI_THEME_PLAN documents, ultimately prioritizing
  the PRD's explicit color values for the new themes. The implementation also
  included refining the theme loading logic in the ThemeSelector to ensure
  consistent theme persistence across sessions. Despite initial tool-related
  challenges in confirming file updates, the final outcome successfully
  integrated the new theme options, providing users with more visual
  customization choices.
