### 1. Create a New Post

- Adds starter content to get you writing immediately
- Organizes everything in a clean date-based structure

**Output:**
```
✅ New post created at: posts/2024/12/2024-12-19.md
ℹ️  Edit your post and then run 'pnpm run publish' when ready.
```

### 2. Write Your Content

Open the generated file in your favorite editor. You'll see:

```markdown
---
title: "New Post on 2024-12-19"
date: "2024.12.19"

---

Write your content here.

Happy writing!
```

**Edit the frontmatter:**

### 3. Publish Your Post

```bash
pnpm run publish
```

**What happens:**

- Prepares everything for deployment
- No manual git commands needed

**Output:**
```

ℹ️  Your post is now ready. Push to your repository when ready to publish.
```

## Customization

### Colors and Theming

The blog uses a developer-friendly color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.ts`:

```typescript
colors: {
  "dev-primary": "#1a1a1a",    // Dark background
  "dev-accent": "#10b981",     // Emerald accent
  "dev-text": "#f8fafc",       // Light text
  "dev-secondary": "#64748b",   // Gray secondary
  "dev-bg": "#0f172a",         // Page background
  "dev-card": "#1e293b",       // Card background
}
```

To customize colors, edit the `tailwind.config.ts` file and update the color values.

### Typography

The blog uses system fonts by default. To add custom fonts:

1. Add font imports to `app/layout.tsx`
2. Update the `fontFamily` section in `tailwind.config.ts`
3. Apply the font classes in your components

### Layout and Components

Key components you can customize:

- `app/components/Navbar.tsx` - Top navigation bar with menu items (includes Motorola link)
- `app/components/SideBar.tsx` - Navigation and search
- `app/components/PostLink.tsx` - Post preview cards
- `app/components/FilteredPosts.tsx` - Post listing and pagination
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles and markdown formatting

### Navigation Bar

The website includes a top navigation bar (`Navbar.tsx`) that appears on all pages. The navbar currently includes:

- **Motorola** - Links to `/motorola` page

To add or modify navbar items, edit the `navbarItems` array in `app/components/Navbar.tsx`.
