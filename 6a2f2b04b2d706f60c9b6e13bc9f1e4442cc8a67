tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button to open a random post. The
  assistant implemented this using a custom button component and Next.js router,
  debugging several import and module resolution issues along the way.
overview: The user wanted to enhance the application by adding a "Surprise me"
  button. This button, styled with a secondary variant and placed at the top
  right of the posts list, needed to navigate to a randomly selected post. The
  assistant identified the  component as the appropriate place
  for this feature. The initial approach involved using Next.js  for
  programmatic navigation. However, this led to several debugging cycles due to
  missing imports and a module resolution error with . The assistant
  temporarily switched to  to bypass the module issue, but
  the user reverted this change, prompting the assistant to re-implement
   and ensure all necessary imports were correctly in place. The
  final outcome is a functional "Surprise me" button that directs users to a
  random post.
