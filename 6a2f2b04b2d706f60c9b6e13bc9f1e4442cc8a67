tldr: The user wanted a 'Surprise me' button to open a random post. After
  several attempts to use  which caused module resolution errors, the
  final implementation uses  for navigation.
overview: The user's intent was to add a 'Surprise me' button that would
  navigate to a random blog post. The button was to be placed at the top right
  of the posts list and use the existing  component with a secondary
  variant. The initial approach involved using  from
   for programmatic navigation. However, this led to recurring
  module resolution errors, specifically with Turbopack in Next.js 15. After
  several attempts to fix the  import and usage, the decision was
  made to switch to  for navigation, which successfully
  bypassed the module resolution issues. The final outcome is a functional
  'Surprise me' button that randomly selects a post and redirects the user to
  it.
