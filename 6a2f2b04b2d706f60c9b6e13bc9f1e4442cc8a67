tldr: The user requested a "Surprise me" button to open a random post, using the
  existing button component and placing it at the top right. The assistant
  implemented the button with navigation to a random post, but the conversation
  ended with an error related to the button component.
overview: The user's intent was to enhance the application with a 'Surprise me'
  feature, allowing users to quickly jump to a random post. The assistant
  approached this by first understanding the existing codebase, including the
   component, post data structure, and routing mechanisms. It then
  identified the  component as the appropriate location for the
  new button. The implementation involved importing necessary hooks and
  components, creating a function to handle random post selection and
  navigation, and integrating the button with the specified styling. However,
  the process was interrupted by an error reported by the user concerning the
   component itself, suggesting further debugging is needed to complete
  the task.
