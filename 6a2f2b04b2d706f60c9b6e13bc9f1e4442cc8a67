tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button to open a random post. The
  assistant implemented the button, including navigation to a random post, and
  fixed an issue where the router hook was not correctly applied initially.
overview: The user requested a "Surprise me" button that would open a random
  post. The assistant began by analyzing the existing codebase to understand the
   component, post routing, and the structure of the main page and
   component. The plan was to add the button to
  , use  for navigation, and implement a function
  to select a random post and generate its slug. During the initial
  implementation, there was a hiccup where the  import and
  constant were not correctly applied, leading to a user-reported error. The
  assistant identified this missing piece and re-applied the necessary changes,
  successfully implementing the button with the correct functionality and
  positioning.
