tldr: The user wants to add a "Surprise me" button to the application. This
  button should use the secondary variant of the existing Button component, be
  placed at the top right, and open a random post. The assistant has started by
  investigating relevant files and routing mechanisms.
overview: The user's intent is to enhance the application with a "Surprise me"
  button. This button will allow users to navigate to a random post, leveraging
  the existing  component with a  style and positioned at the
  top right of the interface. The assistant initiated the task by performing an
  initial code exploration. This involved reading the  component
  definition, examining  for post-related utilities, reviewing
   to understand the layout, and searching the codebase to
  understand how posts are currently routed and linked within the application.
  This foundational research aims to inform the subsequent implementation steps.
