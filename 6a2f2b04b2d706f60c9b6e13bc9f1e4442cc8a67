tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button added to the application. The
  assistant implemented this button in the FilteredPosts component, allowing
  users to navigate to a random post using the existing button component and
  styling.
overview: The user's intent was to enhance the application with a "Surprise me"
  feature, allowing users to discover random posts easily. The assistant
  approached this by first understanding the existing codebase, including the
  button component, post data structure, and routing. It identified
   as the appropriate location for the new button. The
  implementation involved importing , creating a
  function to select a random post and navigate, and integrating the
  component with the specified  variant and top-right absolute
  positioning. The outcome is a functional "Surprise me" button that improves
  content discoverability.
