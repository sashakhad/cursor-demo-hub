tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button to open a random post. The button
  was implemented in FilteredPosts.tsx using useRouter for navigation, but this
  caused a runtime error. The plan is to switch to window.location.href to fix
  the navigation issue.
overview: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application that
  would open a random post. The button was implemented in the FilteredPosts
  component, using the existing Button component with a secondary variant and
  positioned at the top right. The initial approach for navigation involved
  using useRouter from next/navigation to programmatically redirect to a random
  post's URL. However, this led to a runtime error indicating a module
  instantiation issue with next/navigation. To resolve this, the plan is to
  switch to using window.location.href for client-side navigation to the random
  post.
