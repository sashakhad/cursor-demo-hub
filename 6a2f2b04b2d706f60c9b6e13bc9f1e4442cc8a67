overview: "The user wanted to add a 'Surprise me' button to open a random post.
  The button was implemented in the  component, which was
  correctly marked as a client component using 'use client'. However, a runtime
  error occurred during server-side rendering, indicating that the
   module was being instantiated on the server, leading to a
  'module factory is not available' error. To fix this, the
  component was dynamically imported in  with . This
  ensures that the component, and thus its dependency on , is only
  processed and rendered on the client side, resolving the SSR error."
