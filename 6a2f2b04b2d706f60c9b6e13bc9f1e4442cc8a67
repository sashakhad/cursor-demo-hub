tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button to open a random post. After
  several attempts to use  from  which caused module
  resolution errors, the final implementation uses  for
  navigation.
overview: The user's intent was to add a "Surprise me" button to the application
  that would navigate to a random blog post. The button was to be styled using a
   variant and positioned at the top right of the posts list. The
  initial approach involved using Next.js's  hook for programmatic
  navigation. However, this led to recurring module resolution errors,
  specifically with Turbopack, indicating issues with
  module factory. After several attempts to fix the  related errors,
  including re-adding missing imports and declarations, the final decision was
  to switch to  for navigation. This client-side
  navigation method successfully bypassed the module resolution problems,
  achieving the desired functionality.
