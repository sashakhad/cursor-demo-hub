tldr: The user wants to add a "Surprise me" button that navigates to a random
  post. The assistant is currently analyzing the codebase to understand the
  Button component, post routing, and page layout to implement this feature.
overview: The user wants to enhance the application by adding a "Surprise me"
  button. This button, styled with the secondary variant of the existing Button
  component, should be positioned at the top right of the page and, when
  clicked, navigate the user to a random post. The assistant has begun by
  thoroughly examining the codebase to understand the structure of the Button
  component, the routing mechanism for posts (which uses a slugified title), and
  how to retrieve all available post IDs. The next steps involve integrating
  this functionality into the main page layout.
