tldr: The user wants to add a "Surprise me" button that opens a random post,
  styled with the secondary button variant and positioned at the top right. The
  assistant is currently investigating the codebase to determine the best
  placement and implementation strategy.
overview: The user initiated a request to add a "Surprise me" button to the
  application. This button should, when clicked, navigate the user to a random
  post. The button needs to utilize the existing  component with its
   variant and be positioned in the top right corner of the page. The
  assistant's approach involved thoroughly examining the codebase to understand
  post routing, how to retrieve all post IDs, and the structure of the main page
  and its components. The assistant has identified  as a
  strong candidate for where the button should be integrated, having gathered
  all necessary information about the  component and post handling.
