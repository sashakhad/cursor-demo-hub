tldr: The user requested a "Surprise me" button to navigate to a random post.
  The button was implemented in the  component, using the
   variant and positioned at the top right, with a fix for a missing
   import.
overview: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application. This
  button needed to open a random post, utilize the existing  component
  with a  variant, and be placed at the top right of the posts
  display. The assistant first explored the codebase to understand post routing,
  available components, and the best location for the new button, settling on
  the  component. The implementation involved importing
  , adding a  function to select a random post and
  navigate, and rendering the button with appropriate styling. An initial
  attempt had a hiccup where the  import and initialization were not
  correctly applied, leading to an error, which was promptly identified and
  fixed by re-applying the necessary code changes.
