overview: The user wanted to enhance the application by adding a "Surprise me"
  button. This button's purpose was to navigate to a random post when clicked.
  The assistant began by thoroughly examining the codebase to understand the
  existing Button component, how posts are structured and routed, and the
  overall page layout. After identifying  as the ideal
  location, the assistant implemented the feature. This involved importing
   and the  component, creating a  function
  to select a random post and generate its slug, and finally, integrating the
  button with the specified styling and positioning. The solution ensures that
  clicking the button directs the user to a new, random post within the
  application.
