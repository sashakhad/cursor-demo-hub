tldr: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application that
  opens a random post. The assistant implemented the button, handling the
  routing to a random post, and fixed an issue where the  hook was
  not correctly imported and declared.
overview: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application. This
  button needed to use the existing  component with a secondary variant,
  be placed at the top right, and navigate to a random post when clicked. The
  assistant first explored the codebase to understand post routing, how to
  retrieve all posts, and the structure of the  component and main page
  layout. It identified  as the appropriate location for the
  button. The implementation involved importing  from
  , adding a  function to select a random
  post and navigate to its slug, and placing the button with absolute
  positioning. A minor issue was encountered where the  import and
  declaration were not correctly applied in the initial
  operations, which was subsequently fixed.
