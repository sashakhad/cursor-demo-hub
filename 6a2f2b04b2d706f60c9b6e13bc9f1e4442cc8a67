tldr: The user wanted a "Surprise me" button to open a random post. The initial
  implementation faced issues with  not being defined or causing
  module errors. The final fix involved correctly importing  and the
   component, and initializing the router.
overview: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application that
  would navigate to a random post. The button was to be placed at the top right
  of the posts list and use the existing  component with a secondary
  variant. The initial implementation involved importing  from
   and using  for navigation. However, this led to
  a module instantiation error. An attempt to resolve this by using
   was made, but the user reverted this change, leading to
  a  because  was no longer imported or initialized.
  The final solution involved correctly re-adding the  import and the
   constant initialization, along with the  component import, to
  ensure the button and its navigation functionality worked as intended.
