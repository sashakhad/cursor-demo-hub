overview: The user wanted to add a "Surprise me" button to the application that
  would navigate to a random blog post. The assistant identified the
   component as the correct place for this feature. The approach
  involved importing the  hook, creating a function to select a
  random post and navigate to its slug, and integrating the  component
  with the specified  variant and top-right positioning. During
  implementation, an error occurred because the  hook was not
  correctly declared. This was quickly identified and fixed, ensuring the button
  functions as intended.
