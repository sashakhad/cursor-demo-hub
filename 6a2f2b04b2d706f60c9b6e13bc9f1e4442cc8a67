tldr: The user wanted to add a 'Surprise me' button that opens a random post.
  The button was implemented in the FilteredPosts component, initially using
   for navigation, but later switched to  to
  resolve a module instantiation error.
overview: The user's intent was to enhance the application by adding a 'Surprise
  me' button that would navigate to a random post. The approach involved
  identifying the correct component () for placement and
  understanding the existing post data and routing mechanisms. The initial
  implementation used  for navigation, but this led to a module
  instantiation error. A key decision was made to pivot from  to
   to resolve this technical issue, ensuring the button's
  functionality. The outcome is a fully functional 'Surprise me' button that
  provides a random post experience to the user.
