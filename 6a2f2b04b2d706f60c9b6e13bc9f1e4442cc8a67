overview: The user wanted to enhance the application by adding a "Surprise me"
  button. This button, styled with a secondary variant and placed at the top

  handling user-reverted changes, the assistant pivoted to using

  module resolution problems, ensuring the "Surprise me" button now functions as
  intended by redirecting the user to a random post upon click.
