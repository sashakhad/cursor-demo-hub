tldr: The user requested a "Surprise me" button to open a random post, styled

  button component usage, and page layout to implement this feature.

  button. This button, styled with the secondary variant of the existing button
  component, should be positioned at the top right of the page and, when
  clicked, navigate the user to a random post. The assistant is currently in the
  initial phase of understanding the codebase. It has identified how posts are
  routed (), how to fetch all post IDs ( from
  ), and is now looking into the main page layout (,
  ) and the  component to determine the best approach
  for implementation.
