tldr: The user wanted a 'Surprise me' button that opens a random post. The
  button was added to the FilteredPosts component, uses the secondary variant,
  and navigates to a random post when clicked.
overview: The user wanted to enhance the application by adding a 'Surprise me'
  button. This button, styled with the secondary variant of the existing Button
  component, needed to be placed at the top right of the posts display area.
  Upon clicking, it should navigate the user to a randomly selected post. The
  agent identified the  component as the appropriate location
  for this feature. It implemented the functionality by importing
  for navigation, creating a  function to select a random post
  and construct its URL, and then integrating the button with the specified
  styling and positioning. The implementation was verified for correctness and
  linting errors.
