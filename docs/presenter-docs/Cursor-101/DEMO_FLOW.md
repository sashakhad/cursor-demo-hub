## 1. Layout Walkthrough

> Cursor is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) forked from VS Code, now fully built out with AI-native features.
>
> Understanding the layout helps you navigate efficiently and customize your workspace for different tasks.

## 2. Tab + Inline Edit (Cmd+K)

> Cursor Tab provides context-aware, multi-line code suggestions as you type. Inline Edit (Cmd+K) lets you edit code directly using natural language.

**Docs:** [Tab Overview](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview) | [Inline Edit](https://docs.cursor.com/en/inline-edit/overview)

## 3. Agent Chat

> Agent Chat is the command center for agentic workflows within Cursor. An agent is a large language model (LLM) with access to tool calls—in this case, the ability to make changes directly to your codebase.
