# Cursor Features

Modular demo guides for individual Cursor features. Pick any feature to demo without following a specific sequence.

Each feature includes two versions:
- **Text-only** — Quick reference, no images
- **With screenshots** — Step-by-step visual guide

Before demoing, run [/start-demo](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%2Fstart-demo) to launch the development server.
