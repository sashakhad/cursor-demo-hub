# Ask Mode

> Ask Mode lets you explore and understand your codebase without making changes.
>
> Perfect for onboarding, code reviews, or learning how systems work—the agent reads files, searches, and answers questions while keeping your code untouched.

**Docs:** [Ask Mode](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/modes#ask-mode)

## Setup

Switch to Ask Mode by clicking the mode dropdown in the chat panel and selecting "Ask"

## Demo

You can type your own prompt to ask about the codebase, or use the deep link below as a convenience:

- [Get up to speed on this codebase](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=I%20just%20joined%20the%20team%20and%20need%20to%20get%20up%20to%20speed%20on%20this%20codebase.%20What%20does%20it%20do%2C%20how%20is%20it%20structured%2C%20and%20what%20are%20the%20files%20and%20patterns%20I%20should%20understand%20before%20making%20my%20first%20PR%3F)

### Flow

1. Type your own question or click the deep link above
2. Click "Create Chat" to open the prompt
3. Click the mode dropdown (shows "Agent" by default)
4. Select "Ask" mode
5. Submit the question
6. Watch as the agent explores the codebase and explains the structure

### What to Highlight

- Codebase understanding without risk of changes
- Great for onboarding new team members
- Agent reads through files and explains architecture
- No edits are made—purely read-only exploration

- **Code review prep:** Ask "How does the authentication flow work?"
- **Learning patterns:** Ask "What design patterns are used here?"
