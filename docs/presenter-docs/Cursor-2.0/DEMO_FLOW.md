# Cursor 2.0 Demo Flow

## 1. [Introduce Composer](https://cursor.com/blog/composer)

> Composer is our new agent model designed for software engineering intelligence and speed.
>
> On our benchmarks, the model achieves frontier coding results with generation speed four times faster than similar models.

### 1.5. Introduce the Blog App

> This is a simple blog app built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It has a sidebar for browsing posts by year and month, a search bar for filtering, and individual post pages.
>
> We'll use it as a playground to demonstrate Cursor's features.

Use [/start-demo](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%2Fstart-demo) to launch the development server and open the app in browser.

## 3. [Plan Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning#plan-mode)

> Plan Mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing any code.
>
> Agent researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a reviewable plan you can edit before building.

## 4. [Parallel Agents (Worktrees)](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/worktrees)

> This feature allows you to run multiple agents locally in parallel.
>
> Parallel agents run in their own worktree, allowing them to make edits, or build and test code without interfering with each other.

### 4.5. Reset
Use custom slash command [/reset](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=%2Freset) to clean workspace

---

## 5. [Best of N (Worktrees)](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/worktrees)

> This feature allows you to run a single prompt across multiple models at once.
>
> Use cases: learning each model's strengths, tackling high-priority bugs where you want multiple perspectives, or comparing architectural approaches.

### [Best of N Judge](https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-2-2-multi-agent-judging/145826)

> Run a prompt across multiple models, then Cursor judges and picks the best solution.

**Step 1: Select Worktree mode and choose 3-4 models**

**Step 2: Run the prompt**

- [Add Back to Home Link](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=Add%20a%20%22Back%20to%20Home%22%20link%20at%20the%20top%20of%20each%20blog%20post%20page.)

**Step 3: Judge picks the best solution**

**Compare model results and judge selects the best implementation:**
