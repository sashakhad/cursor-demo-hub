# Cursor 201 Demo Flow

An intermediate walkthrough covering Rules, Commands, Context Management, and Model Selection.

---

## Rules

> Rules provide system-level instructions to Agent. They bundle prompts, scripts, and more together, making it easy to manage and share workflows across your team.

## Commands

> Custom commands allow you to create reusable workflows that can be triggered with a simple `/` prefix in the chat input box. These commands help standardize processes across your team and make common tasks more efficient.

## Context Management

> Understanding and managing the context window is essential for getting the best results from AI-assisted coding. Think of it as managing the model's attention span.

## Model Selection Strategies

> Choosing the right model for the task at hand can significantly impact both quality and speed. Understanding when to use thinking vs. executing models helps you work more efficiently.

## Plan Mode

> Plan Mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing any code.
>
> Agent researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a reviewable plan you can edit before building.

## Debug Mode

> Debug Mode helps you find root causes and fix tricky bugs that are hard to reproduce or understand.
