tldr: The user wanted to reset their Git repository to a clean state for a demo.
  The assistant ran a reset script, confirmed the clean state, and informed the
  user the repository was ready for the next demo step.
overview: The user's intent was to prepare their Git repository for the next
  step of a demo by resetting it to a clean state. The assistant followed the
  provided instructions, which involved executing a  script. This
  script performed a hard reset, removed untracked files, and stashed any
  uncommitted changes to ensure a pristine working directory. After running the
  script, the assistant verified the repository's clean status using usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
