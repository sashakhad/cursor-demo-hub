tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner with specific styling and a link
  to be added to all pages. The assistant is currently analyzing the project
  structure and styling to implement this.
overview: The user wants to add a sticky bottom banner across all pages of the
  application. This banner needs to display specific text, link to Cursor's
  website, and adhere to a defined color scheme (cream background, dark text)
  with a subtle top border. The assistant is in the process of gathering
  information by examining the existing layout, global styles, Tailwind CSS
  configuration, and existing components to ensure a consistent and correct
  implementation. The next steps involve creating the banner component and
  integrating it into the main layout.
