tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner with specific text, link, and
  styling to be added to all pages. The assistant began by analyzing the
  existing layout, global CSS, and Tailwind configuration to understand the
  codebase before implementation.

  all pages of the application. This banner needed to display specific text,
