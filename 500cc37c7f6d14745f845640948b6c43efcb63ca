tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner with specific text, a link, and
  custom colors. The agent has understood the requirements and color
  definitions, and is currently determining the correct location to create the
  new component.
overview: The user's intent was to add a "Made with love ❤️ from Cursor" banner,
  linking to https://cursor.com, to the bottom of all pages. The banner needed a
  cream background (bg-dev-bg), dark text (text-dev-text), and a subtle top
  border. The agent began by examining the existing layout and global CSS, then
  confirmed the Tailwind color definitions. A key decision point arose when the
  expected  directory was not found, leading the agent to
  investigate the  directory for component placement. The banner has not
  yet been implemented.
