tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner for all pages with specific
  styling and a link. The agent is currently investigating the project's
  component structure to determine where to create and place the banner, as the
  expected  directory was not found.
overview: The user's intent was to add a "Made with love ❤️ from Cursor" banner,
  linking to , to the bottom of all pages. The banner needed
  a cream background (), dark text (), and a subtle
  top border. The agent began by examining the  and
   files to understand the existing layout and styling. It then
  checked  to confirm the color definitions for the
  specified classes. The agent attempted to locate an existing
  directory to understand the project's component structure but found that it
  did not exist. The agent is now exploring the  directory to find where
  components are typically stored before proceeding with the banner's
  implementation.
