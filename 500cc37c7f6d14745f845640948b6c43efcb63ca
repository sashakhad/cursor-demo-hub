  styling and a link. The assistant is currently gathering information about the
  project structure and styling to implement this.
overview: The user wants to implement a sticky bottom banner across all pages of
  the application. The banner needs to display specific text, link to Cursor's
  website, and adhere to a defined color scheme (cream background with dark
  text) along with a subtle top border. The assistant is currently in the
  information-gathering phase, analyzing the existing layout, global CSS,
  Tailwind configuration, and component structure to ensure a consistent and
  correct implementation. The next steps involve creating the banner component
  and integrating it into the main layout.
