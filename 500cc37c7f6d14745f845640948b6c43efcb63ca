tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner with specific text, link, and
  styling to be visible on all pages. The assistant began by examining the
  existing layout and global CSS to understand the current structure and styling
  patterns.
overview: "The user's intent was to add a consistent branding element across all
  pages: a sticky banner at the bottom. This banner was specified to include a
  particular message, a link to Cursor's website, and distinct styling (cream
  background, dark text, subtle top border). The assistant initiated the task by
  reviewing the project's  and  files. This approach
  was taken to ensure the new banner integrates seamlessly with the existing
  design and structure, allowing the assistant to understand the current styling
  conventions and where best to inject the new component."
