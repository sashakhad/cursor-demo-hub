tldr: The user wants to add a sticky bottom banner to all pages with specific
  text, a link, and styling. The assistant is currently analyzing the existing
  codebase to prepare for the banner's implementation.
overview: The user intends to add a "Made with love ❤️ from Cursor" banner to
  the bottom of every page, which will link to cursor.com. The banner needs to
  have a cream background (bg-dev-bg), dark text (text-dev-text), and a subtle
  top border for visibility. The assistant is currently in the initial phase of
  understanding the project's structure and styling. It has reviewed the
  layout.tsx, globals.css, and tailwind.config.ts files to gather necessary
  information before proceeding with the banner's creation and integration.
