tldr: The user requested a sticky bottom banner on all pages with specific text,
  a link, and styling. The assistant successfully implemented this by creating a
  new Banner component and integrating it into the main layout.
overview: The user wanted to add a sticky bottom banner to all pages of the
  application. The banner needed to display "Made with love ❤️ from Cursor",
  link to https://cursor.com, and use specific cream background and dark text
  colors with a subtle top border. The assistant first analyzed the existing
  layout and styling, including Tailwind CSS configurations for the specified
  colors. After identifying the correct location for components within
  , a new  component was created. This component was
  then integrated into  to ensure it was rendered consistently
  at the bottom of every page. The implementation successfully met all the
  user's requirements.
