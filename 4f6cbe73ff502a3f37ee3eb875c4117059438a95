tldr: The agent successfully implemented dark mode and a theme toggle feature.
  This involved configuring Tailwind CSS, defining theme-specific CSS variables,
  creating a toggle component, and refactoring several existing components to be
  theme-aware.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement a dark mode feature and a
  theme toggle. The agent began by reviewing the provided product and plan
  documents, then proceeded to configure Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode
  and establish CSS variables for both light and dark themes. A dedicated
   component was developed and integrated into the application's
  main layout, along with a client-side script for initial theme detection. A
  key part of the implementation involved systematically refactoring various UI
  components, such as , , , ,
  , , and , to replace hardcoded colors and inline
  styles with the newly defined theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes.
  This ensured a consistent and dynamic theme application across the user
  interface.
