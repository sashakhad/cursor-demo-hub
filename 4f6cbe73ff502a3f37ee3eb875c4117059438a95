tldr: The user requested implementing dark mode and a theme toggle for the blog,
  following specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent successfully implemented
  this by configuring Tailwind CSS, defining theme-aware CSS variables, creating
  a theme toggle component, and updating various components to support both
  light and dark modes.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  for the blog, guided by DARK_MODE_PRD and DARK_MODE_PLAN. The approach
  involved a systematic review of existing styles and components, followed by a
  phased implementation. Key steps included configuring Tailwind CSS for
  class-based dark mode, defining comprehensive light and dark theme CSS
  variables, and developing an accessible ThemeToggle component. A crucial
  decision was to add an inline script in layout.tsx to prevent a flash of
  unstyled content (FOUC). Numerous components, such as FilteredPosts, PostLink,
  TextLink, Button, SideBar, Input, and Divider, were meticulously updated to
  use theme-aware classes or CSS variables, replacing hardcoded colors and
  inline styles. The outcome is a fully functional dark mode implementation that
  respects user preferences, persists choices, and maintains brand consistency
  across both themes.
