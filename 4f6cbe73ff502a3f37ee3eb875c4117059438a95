  the provided PRD and PLAN documents. This involved updating Tailwind config,
  defining CSS variables, creating a ThemeToggle component, and making various
  component-level adjustments for theme awareness.
overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  across the application, guided by specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent
  began by configuring Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode and defining
  comprehensive CSS variables for both light and dark themes. A dedicated
   component was developed with accessibility in mind, and an
  inline script was integrated into  to prevent a flash of unstyled
  content (FOUC) upon page load. Key components such as ,
  , , and  were refactored to utilize the new
  theme-aware color variables. Additionally, hardcoded inline styles in
  , , and  components were replaced with dynamic
  Tailwind classes to ensure consistent theming. The final implementation
  provides a robust, accessible, and persistent dark mode experience.
