tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The assistant successfully implemented this
  by configuring Tailwind CSS, defining CSS variables for themes, creating a
  ThemeToggle component, and integrating it into the main layout with
  client-side theme persistence.
overview: The user's intent was to add dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle to the application. The assistant approached this by first reviewing
  the provided requirements documents and existing code to understand the
  project structure and color usage. A detailed plan was then formulated, which
  involved updating tailwind.config.ts to enable class-based dark mode and map
  colors to CSS variables. globals.css was modified to define distinct light and
  dark theme CSS variables. A new ThemeToggle React component was created to
  handle theme switching and persistence in local storage. Finally, layout.tsx
  was updated to include a theme initialization script and integrate the
  ThemeToggle component, ensuring the theme is applied correctly on page load.
