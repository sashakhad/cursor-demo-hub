tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent has started by configuring Tailwind
  CSS for dark mode, defining CSS variables for light and dark themes, and
  creating a ThemeToggle component.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate dark mode functionality and a theme
  toggle into the application. The agent began by thoroughly reviewing the
  provided product and plan documents, then identified and read relevant
  configuration and component files. The approach involved a structured todo
  list, starting with updating tailwind.config.ts to enable class-based dark
  mode and map colors to CSS variables. Subsequently, globals.css was modified
  to define distinct light and dark theme variables. A ThemeToggle component was
  also created to allow users to switch between themes. The implementation is
  currently in progress, with several key foundational steps already completed.
