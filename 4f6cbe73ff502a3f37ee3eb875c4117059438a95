tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  has set up the core dark mode functionality by configuring Tailwind CSS,
  defining CSS variables, creating a theme toggle component, and integrating it
  into the layout. It's now in the process of updating existing components to be
  theme-aware.
overview: The user's intent was to introduce dark mode and a theme toggle
  feature into the application. The agent began by reviewing the provided PRD
  and plan documents, then systematically implemented the changes. This involved
  configuring Tailwind CSS to support class-based dark mode, defining a
  comprehensive set of CSS variables for both light and dark themes in
  globals.css, and developing a ThemeToggle component for user interaction. A
  critical step was integrating a theme initialization script and the
  ThemeToggle into layout.tsx to ensure consistent theme application across the
  site. The agent is currently in the process of updating individual components,
  such as FilteredPosts.tsx, to utilize the new theme variables and classes,
  ensuring a complete and consistent dark mode experience.
