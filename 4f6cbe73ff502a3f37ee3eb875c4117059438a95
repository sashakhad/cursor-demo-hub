overview: The user initiated a request to implement dark mode and a theme
  toggle, referencing specific PRD and PLAN documents. The agent began by
  reviewing these documents and then systematically updated the codebase. Key

  CSS variables for theme colors in , and creating a
  component. An important decision was to add an inline script in
