tldr: The user requested the implementation of dark mode and a theme toggle. The
  task involved updating Tailwind configuration, defining CSS variables for
  themes, creating a theme toggle component, and making various components
  theme-aware to ensure a consistent user experience across light and dark
  modes.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  based on provided PRD and PLAN documents. The approach involved a systematic
  update of the application's styling infrastructure. Key steps included
  configuring Tailwind for class-based dark mode, defining comprehensive CSS
  variables for both light and dark themes in globals.css, and developing a
  ThemeToggle component. A crucial decision was to integrate a theme
  initialization script in layout.tsx to prevent a flash of unstyled content
  (FOUC). Additionally, numerous components like FilteredPosts, PostLink,
  TextLink, Button, SideBar, Input, and Divider were refactored to utilize the
  new theme variables and classes, ensuring a consistent and accessible dark
  mode experience. The implementation successfully addressed all requirements,
  including system preference detection and user choice persistence.
