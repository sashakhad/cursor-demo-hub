tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully updated Tailwind configuration, CSS variables, created a theme
  toggle component, and refactored several components to be theme-aware,
  following the provided PRD and PLAN documents.
overview: The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle
  feature, guided by existing PRD and PLAN documents. The approach involved a
  systematic refactoring of the application's styling. Key steps included
  enabling class-based dark mode in , defining comprehensive
  light and dark theme CSS variables in , and developing a
   component for user interaction. A critical part of the
  implementation was integrating a theme initialization script in
  to handle initial theme loading and user preferences. Additionally, numerous
  components were updated to replace hardcoded colors and inline styles with
  theme-aware Tailwind classes and CSS variables, ensuring a consistent look
  across both light and dark modes. Special care was taken to correctly handle
  specific color usages, such as  on primary buttons, which remained
  consistent, versus text on dynamic backgrounds that needed to adapt. The
  outcome is a fully functional dark mode implementation with a user-controlled
  theme toggle.
