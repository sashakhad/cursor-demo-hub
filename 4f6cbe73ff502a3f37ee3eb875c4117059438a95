tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle. The agent
  successfully updated Tailwind CSS configuration, defined theme-specific CSS
  variables, created a theme toggle component, and refactored existing
  components to be theme-aware.
overview: The user wanted to add dark mode functionality and a theme toggle to
  the application. The agent started by reviewing the provided PRD and plan
  documents, then analyzed the existing codebase to understand file structure
  and current color usage. The implementation involved configuring Tailwind CSS
  for dark mode, defining CSS variables for light and dark themes, creating a
   component, and integrating it into the main layout. Key
  components were updated to use theme-aware classes, ensuring a consistent look
  across both themes. The agent carefully handled edge cases, such as pagination
  button styling, to ensure proper color transitions. The outcome is a fully
  functional dark mode with a user-controlled theme toggle.
