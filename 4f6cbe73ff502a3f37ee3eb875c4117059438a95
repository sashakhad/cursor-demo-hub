tldr: The user requested to implement dark mode and a theme toggle based on
  provided PRD and PLAN documents. The agent successfully updated Tailwind
  configuration, CSS variables, created a theme toggle component, and refactored
  several components to be theme-aware.
overview: "The user initiated a task to implement dark mode and a theme toggle,
  adhering to the specified design documents. The agent began by reviewing the
  requirements and existing codebase. The approach involved a series of
  structured steps: enabling class-based dark mode in ,
  defining comprehensive light and dark CSS variable sets in ,
  developing a  component, and integrating it into the main
   with a theme initialization script. Crucially, numerous
  components were refactored to replace hardcoded colors and inline styles with
  theme-aware Tailwind classes and CSS variables, ensuring a consistent dark
  mode experience. The agent also addressed and confirmed that certain
   and  usages were intentional per the design. The
  implementation successfully delivered a functional dark mode with a toggle."
