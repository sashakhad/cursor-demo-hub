tldr: The user wanted a scroll-to-top button fixed at the bottom-right of the
  page that appears after scrolling and returns to the top on click. I
  implemented this by creating a new  React component and
  integrating it into the main layout.
overview: The user wanted to add a scroll-to-top button to the website. The
  button needed to be fixed at the bottom-right, appear only after the user
  scrolled down, and smoothly return the page to the top when clicked. I started
  by exploring the codebase to understand the project structure, existing
  components, and styling conventions. I then created a new client-side React
  component called . This component uses React hooks to manage
  its visibility based on the scroll position (appearing after 300 pixels). It
  includes an inline SVG for an up arrow icon and is styled to be a fixed,
  rounded button at the bottom-right of the screen. Finally, I integrated this
   component into the  file, ensuring it would be
  present and functional across all pages of the application.
