tldr: The user wanted a scroll-to-top button fixed at the bottom-right of the
  page that appears after scrolling and returns to the top on click. I
  implemented a new  React component and integrated it into the
  application's layout.
overview: The user wanted to add a scroll-to-top button to the website. The
  button needed to be fixed at the bottom-right, appear after the user scrolled
  down, and smoothly return the page to the top when clicked. I created a new
  client-side React component called . This component uses
   and  to manage its visibility based on the scroll
  position, appearing after 300 pixels of vertical scroll. It includes an inline
  SVG for an up arrow icon and is styled to be fixed at the bottom-right of the
  viewport. Finally, I integrated this  component into the
   file, ensuring it is present across all pages of the
  application.
