tldr: The user requested a scroll-to-top button for their website. The assistant
  implemented a new  React component that appears after scrolling,
  is fixed at the bottom-right, and smoothly scrolls to the top when clicked.
overview: The user wanted to enhance their website with a scroll-to-top button.
  The assistant began by exploring the existing codebase to understand the
  project structure and styling conventions. It then proceeded to create a new
   React component. This component leverages React's
  and  hooks to manage its visibility based on the user's scroll
  position, appearing after scrolling down 300 pixels. The button is styled
  using Tailwind CSS to be a fixed, circular element positioned at the
  bottom-right of the screen, featuring an inline SVG for an upward-pointing
  arrow. Clicking the button triggers a smooth scroll animation back to the top
  of the page. The component was designed with client-side interactivity in
  mind, indicated by the  directive, and is intended to be
  integrated into the main layout for consistent availability across all pages.
