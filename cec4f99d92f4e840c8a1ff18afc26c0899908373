tldr: The user wants to add a scroll-to-top button to the application. I am
  currently exploring the codebase to understand the project structure and
  determine the best place to implement this feature.
overview: "The user initiated a request to implement a scroll-to-top button with
  specific functionalities: fixed positioning, conditional visibility based on
  scroll, and scroll-to-top on click. My current approach involves an initial
  exploration of the existing codebase to identify suitable files and components
  for integration. I've reviewed , , and , and
  listed the contents of the  directory to understand the project
  structure before proceeding with the implementation."
