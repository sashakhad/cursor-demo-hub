tldr: The user requested to add a scroll-to-top button with specific
  functionalities. The assistant began by exploring the codebase to identify the
  appropriate location and structure for implementing this feature.
overview: The user's intent was to integrate a scroll-to-top button into the
  application. This button needed to be fixed at the bottom-right of the screen,
  become visible only after the user scrolls down, and navigate to the top of
  the page upon clicking. The assistant's initial approach involved examining
  the existing codebase, specifically looking at , , and
  the  directory, to understand the project's architecture and
  identify the best place to add the new component. The conversation ended
