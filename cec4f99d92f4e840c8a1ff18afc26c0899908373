overview: The user wanted to add a scroll-to-top button to the website. The
  assistant began by thoroughly exploring the codebase to understand the
  existing structure, components, and styling. It then created a new client-side
  React component, , which dynamically appears after the user
  scrolls down 300 pixels. This button is fixed at the bottom-right of the
  screen and, when clicked, smoothly scrolls the page back to the top. The
  component was styled using Tailwind CSS and includes a custom SVG for an
  upward arrow. Finally, the  component was integrated into the
   to ensure it's available across all pages, and linting was
