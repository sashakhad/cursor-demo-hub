- Use functional components only.
- Always define explicit props interfaces or types.
- Do not use `any` or implicit `unknown`.
- Prefer named function declarations over anonymous arrow exports.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid complex logic in JSX. Extract it into helper functions.
