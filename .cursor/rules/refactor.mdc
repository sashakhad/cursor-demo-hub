Apply this rule only when explicitly refactoring code.

- Do not change behavior unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve public APIs and function signatures.
- Prefer small, mechanical transformations.
- Improve naming, structure, and readability.
- Remove dead code and obvious duplication.
- Do not introduce new abstractions unless necessary.

Before making changes:
- Identify the intent of the existing code.
- Call out any ambiguous behavior before modifying it.
