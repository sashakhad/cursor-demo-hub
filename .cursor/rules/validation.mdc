description: Best practices when handling client side and server side validation

# Validation Standards

- Inputs must be validated before running any business logic.
- Validation must happen on both client and server.
- Use a schema validation library such as Zod.
- Do not assume inputs are well-formed.
- Validation must happen at the top of the route handler.
- If validation fails, return early with an error.
