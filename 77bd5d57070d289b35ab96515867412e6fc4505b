tldr: The user initiated a repository reset to clean up their Git workspace.
  This action prepares the repository for the next demo step by removing all
  uncommitted changes and untracked files, ensuring a clean working state.
overview: The user's intent was to thoroughly clean their Git repository to
  ensure a pristine state for an ongoing demo. They used a  command,
  which is designed to remove all artifacts from previous demo steps, including
  uncommitted changes and untracked files. The approach involves running a
  specific  script that stashes current changes, hard resets the
  repository, and cleans up untracked files. The outcome is a completely clean
  working directory, ready for the next phase of the demo without any lingering
  modifications or files from prior steps.
